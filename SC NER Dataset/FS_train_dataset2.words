Practices like CI/CD and automation have become the norm in every engineering organization.
Research, on behalf of Atlassian, conducted an online survey among 500 Developers & IT Decision Makers in February 2020
Traditionally, many organizations have dedicated systems admins or Ops teams responsible for running IT operations.
A relatively new role popularized by Google, site reliability engineers are software engineers who design, code, and maintain an operations function.
Senior developers get involved in on-call work as secondary responders when escalation is required.
In Companies of all sizes, including leading tech companies like Atlassian, Amazon, Google, and Netflix, expect all engineers to take on-call responsibilities to varying degrees. For example, while Amazon focuses on full ownership and expects developers to take on-call responsibilities, Google follows the principles of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and expects a healthy relationship between SRE teams and service teams (more on this later in the “Site reliability engineering approach to on call” section, below).
Google’s VP of Engineering and father of SRE, Ben Treynor, defines site reliability engineers as software engineers who design an operations function.
n an on-call setting, escalation is the process of notifying backup team members, more highly technical engineers, or managers to ensure that incidents are addressed as quickly and effectively as possible.
SAFe assumes teams are following an Agile (Scrum or Kanban) methodology.
As agile teams matured and grew, they became challenged with how to:
Product owner is responsible for defining stories, prioritizing the team backlog, review, and accepting stories.
Scrum master is responsible for lean-agile leadership, agile process facilitation, enabling the team, and removal of impediments.
Scrum team is a group of individuals responsible for defining, building, and testing components/features within their agile process.
System architect/engineer is responsible for alignment with enterprise and solution architecture, and identifying and creation of solution architecture to be delivered by teams architecture.
Product management is responsible for product backlog content and prioritization.
Product security is responsible for the security of our products and platforms.
Security intelligence is responsible for detecting and responding to security incidents.
Development and SRE are responsible for building and running tooling for the security team.
While our security team continues to expand, everyone at Atlassian is part of our vision; We want to lead our peers in cloud security, meet all customer requirements for cloud security, exceed requirements for all industry security standards and certifications and be proud to publish details about how we protect customer data. Our goals and vision are made clear to all of our staff throughout their time here at Atlassian.
Atlassian recognizes that, at some level, security vulnerabilities are an inherent part of any software development process.
No discussion of vulnerability management would be complete without explaining the key role our product security engineers have in both ironing out bugs, and designing better irons.
Our product security engineers perform the initial triage on newly reported vulnerabilities and collaborate with our product engineering teams to identify the best fix for the issue. Our product security engineers are subject matter experts in application security and are distributed globally so that they can most effectively collaborate with our product engineers as needed.
While containers offer great benefits for our developers and customers in terms of being able to deploy code that can be used in a variety of environments, they can be a source of security vulnerabilities if the contents of the images consist of out-of-date or otherwise insecure libraries or components.
Our security engineers has both pro-active and re-active security roles in relation to their assigned product, including but not limited to:
The Atlassian Security Team creates alerts on our security analytics platform and monitors for indicators of compromise. Our SRE teams use this platform to monitor for availability or performance issues. Logs are retained for 30 days in hot backup, and 365 days in cold backup.
Specifically, that means Dagger lets DevOps engineers write their pipelines as declarative models in CUE (which stands for “configure, unify, execute”). With this, engineers can describe their pipelines and connect the different pieces to each other, all in code. Dagger calls these individual pieces “actions” and they, too, are described declaratively.

These concerns represent a shared responsibility between the developer, build team, infrastructure/cloud provider, and operating system provider.
Software producers and consumers should perform threat modeling of their systems to assess their needs and make conscious decisions about risk appetite and security controls.
These concerns represent a shared responsibility between the developer, build team, infrastructure/cloud provider, and operating system provider.
The GoodData Enterprise Insights platform is designed to help enterprises and independent software vendors (ISVs) securely transform their data into actionable insights and deliver them to business users, customers, and partners at their point of work to drive better business outcomes.
Users added to the GoodData Enterprise Insights platform are not given broad access to the network but to an explicit workspace that is assigned to a “consumer” site. This ensures that users only have access to the workspaces appropriate for them.
To ensure that security is built into all aspects of the GoodData platform, the GoodData engineering team follows DevSecOps methodology. Our software engineers and operations staff are trained on secure development practices and use a wide range of technical means, which are built directly into the continuous integration infrastructure, to address risks related to code flaws and vulnerabilities as well as to prevent promotion of changes without proper review and approval.
Events related to security are evaluated, investigated and tracked to resolution by a Security Operations team, reporting directly into the Platform Delivery organization. Security Operations team is also responsible for developing and maintaining comprehensive security monitoring and security response program both on the technical and organizational levels, and for the corporate patch and vulnerability management program.
All new employees around the world are subject to an industry standard background check. GoodData has established three levels of a security clearance; the highest level, which has the most demanding background check requirements and which has to be regularly renewed, is mandatory for all key security-related roles as well as for personnel with the highest level of administrative access to the GoodData platform and critical internal systems.
GoodData has appointed a dedicated information security organization led by the chief information security officer (CISO), who has the executive responsibility for information security across the corporation and leads the security and compliance department.
Additionally, endpoints of non-technical personnel have an MDM solution installed and are fully managed by the Internal IT department. Acceptable use rules are documented and communicated to all employees.
Data processing and cleanup can consume more than half of an analytics team’s time, including that of highly paid data scientists, which limits scalability and frustrates employees. Indeed, the productivity of employees across the organization can suffer: respondents to our 2019 Global Data Transformation Survey reported that an average of 30 percent of their total enterprise time was spent on non-value-added tasks because of poor data quality and availability (Exhibit 1).
They then worked in sprints to identify priority data based on the value they could deliver, checking in with the CEO and senior leadership team every few weeks.
For example, organizations can apply light governance for data that is used only in an exploration setting and not beyond the boundaries of the science team. The team may also not need perfectly prepared and integrated data with full metadata available.
Data processing and cleanup can consume more than half of an analytics team’s time, including that of highly paid data scientists, which limits scalability and frustrates employees.

In 2016, Thomson Reuters decided to build a solution that would enable it to capture, analyze, and visualize analytics data generated by its offerings, providing insights to help product teams continuously improve the user experience.
And, because the group that would be building the solution was relatively small, the company needed to minimize administration and management tasks so it could focus on building new features and supporting product teams.
Our security team worked closely with AWS to review infrastructure, software, and services and found we could build our system in a way that complied with those requirements.
“It’s easy to read and modify AWS Step Functions,” says Filip Pýrek, serverless architect at Purple Technology.

I am proud that Anaplan delivered a very strong fourth quarter and finished the year with over 1,900 customers.
Based in San Francisco, Anaplan has over 175 partners and more than 1,900 customers worldwide.
If we experience a security incident affecting our platform, networks, systems or data or the data of our customers, or are perceived to have experienced such a security incident, our platform may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our platform, we may incur significant liabilities, and our business could be materially adversely affected.
As of 2016, Anaplan had over 480 customers in 20 countries.
Enterprise customers can upload data to the Anaplan cloud, letting the customer's business users organize and analyze disparate sets of enterprise data from finance, human resources, sales and other business units.
Revise the access of each user and set ‘No Access’ if that user is no longer using the model. Setting ‘No Access’ will reduce the cell count of a module where the User list is being used.
Begin by revisiting all the tabs in the User Access setting and set appropriate access by roles. A common mistake is granting full access to all roles, even though a specific role shouldn't have access to this complete level of items.
Grant proper access as per each role in module settings. For instance, if the role doesn’t have to do any manual input to a module, then mark it as 'Read'.
Breaking up the models mitigates the risk that someone accidentally was given inappropriate access by keeping finance partners in their own planning model (PBF), hiring managers in their own model (this is the largest user base in the process), and human resources and recruiting planning in their existing recruiting management model.
Lefouet said Anaplan was on track to sign up 150,000 users this year, and should triple that number in 2016, putting it in reach of 1 million users by 2017 or 2018, he said. By contrast, SAP and Oracle count tens of million of cloud software users, although these numbers include a far broader set of products.
While Anaplan, now based in San Francisco, could consider an initial public offering (IPO) in the coming year, it is focused on its next milestone of signing up 1 million users, or an average of 1,000 users across 1,000 global accounts, Lefouet said.
But a calculation based on the 45,000 customers Anaplan says it has signed up combined with an estimated average annual subscription fee comparable to Salesforce.com’s roughly $1,000, suggests revenue is nearing $50 million (45 million euros).
The company can now show its corporate customers when and where their employees log in to Anaplan, and how long they used it, on a dashboard.

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling supports the following types of dynamic scaling policies:
Target tracking scaling — Increase and decrease the current capacity of the group based on a Amazon CloudWatch metric and a target value.
Step scaling—Increase and decrease the current capacity of the group based on a set of scaling adjustments, known as step adjustments, that vary based on the size of the alarm breach.
Simple scaling—Increase and decrease the current capacity of the group based on a single scaling adjustment, with a cooldown period between each scaling activity.
If you are scaling based on a metric that increases or decreases proportionally to the number of instances in an Auto Scaling group, we recommend that you use target tracking scaling policies. Otherwise, we recommend that you use step scaling policies.
With target tracking, an Auto Scaling group scales in direct proportion to the actual load on your application. That means that in addition to meeting the immediate need for capacity in response to load changes, a target tracking policy can also adapt to load changes that take place over time, for example, due to seasonal variations.
When you use an Auto Scaling group without any form of dynamic scaling, it doesn't scale on its own unless you set up scheduled scaling or predictive scaling.
An Auto Scaling group has a maximum capacity of 3, a current capacity of 2, and a dynamic scaling policy that adds 3 instances. When invoking this policy, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling adds only 1 instance to the group to prevent the group from exceeding its maximum size.
An Auto Scaling group has a minimum capacity of 2, a current capacity of 3, and a dynamic scaling policy that removes 2 instances. When invoking this policy, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling removes only 1 instance from the group to prevent the group from becoming less than its minimum size.
When the desired capacity reaches the maximum size limit, scaling out stops. If demand drops and capacity decreases, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can scale out again.
In this case, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can scale out above the maximum size limit, but only by up to your maximum instance weight. Its intention is to get as close to the new desired capacity as possible but still adhere to the allocation strategies that are specified for the group.
An Auto Scaling group has a maximum capacity of 12, a current capacity of 10, and a dynamic scaling policy that adds 5 capacity units.
NoSQL cloud database services, like Amazon DynamoDB, are popular for their simple key-value operations, unbounded scalability and predictable low-latency. Atomic transactions, while popular in relational databases, carry the specter of complexity and low performance, especially when used for workloads with high contention.

Load balancing enables scalability, avoids bottlenecks and also reduces time taken to give the respond. Many load balancing algorithm [2] have been designed in order to schedule the load among various machines. But so far there is no such ideal load balancing algorithm has been developed which will allocate the load evenly across the system.
This simply means that the software intelligent load balancers are also used to provide actionable insights to an organization. In this section, we look at how routing is done in SDN to facilitate for intelligent load balancing. In order to appreciate the power of intelligent load balancing routing in SDN and its advantages, we first cover a summary of load balancing routing in IP networks.
Load unbalancing problem is a multi-variant, multi-constraint problem that degrades performance and efficiency of computing resources. Load balancing techniques cater the solution for load unbalancing situation for two undesirable facets- overloading and under-loading.
Load balancing is the process of redistribution of workload in a distributed system like cloud computing ensuring no computing machine is overloaded, under-loaded or idle [12, 13]. Load balancing tries to speed up different constrained parameters like response time, execution time, system stability etc. thereby improving performance of cloud [14, 15]. It is an optimization technique in which task scheduling is an NP hard problem. There are a large number of load balancing approaches proposed by researchers where most of focus has been concerned on task scheduling, task allocation, resource scheduling, resource allocation, and resource management.
It has sustained the rapid global growth of Google services, and it also provides network load balancing for Google Cloud Platform.
We’ll discuss Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB) as a concrete example of large-scale load balancing, but nearly all of the best practices we describe also apply to other cloud providers’ load balancers.
Autoscale using a capacity metric as observed by the load balancer. This will automatically discount unhealthy instances from the average.
If your site gets popular on social media and suddenly experiences a five-fold increase in traffic, you’d prefer to serve what requests you can. Therefore, you implement load shedding to drop excess traffic. In this case, your system needs to use both load balancing and load shedding.
Load balancing, load shedding, and autoscaling are all systems designed for the same goal: to equalize and stabilize the system load.
Dressy’s development teams investigate and notice a problem: their load balancing is inexplicably drawing all user traffic into region A, even though that region is full-to-overflowing and both B and C are empty (and equally large).
Load balancing minimizes latency by routing to the location closest to the user. Autoscaling can work together with load balancing to increase the size of locations close to the user and then route more traffic there, creating a positive feedback loop.
Currently, load balancing in the cloud (LBC) is one of the main challenges that allows avoiding the situation of overloading/underloading in virtual machines during task computation.
Load balancing provides the facility to distribute the workload equally on available resources. Its objective is to provide continuous service in case of failure of any service’s component by provisioning and deprovisioning the application instances along with proper utilization of resources.
Load balancer helps in allocation of resources to the tasks fairly for resource utilization and user satisfaction at minimum cost, which motivates us to find issues in load balancing and to work on resolving them.
load balancing, there are various challenges, such as resource scheduling, performance monitoring, QoS management, energy consumption, and service availability in the cloud.
You must also consider other functionalities that may be necessary for your specific workload—for example, ingestion requirements, push-down compute requirements, and size at limit.
The choice depends heavily on your use case — transactional processing, analytical processing, in-memory database, and so on — but it also depends on other factors. This post covers the different database options available within Google Cloud across relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases and explains which use cases are best suited for each database option.
Non-relational databases are often used when large quantities of complex and diverse data need to be organized, or where the structure of the data is regularly evolving to meet new business requirements. Unlike relational databases, they perform faster because a query doesn’t have to access several tables to deliver an answer, making them ideal for storing data that may change frequently or for applications that handle many different kinds of data.
Workload capacity is the construct we have used to refer to the cognitive mechanism underpinning multitasking.
Our previous research using test runs, execution time, and test input information for reliability analysis and improvement is extended to ensure better test workload measurements for reliability assessment and prediction.
However, benchmarking and comparing the energy efficiency of GPGPU workloads is challenging as standardized workloads are rare and standardized power and efficiency measurement methods and metrics do not exist. In addition, not all GPGPU systems run at maximum load all the time. Systems that are utilized in transactional, request driven workloads, for example, can run at lower utilization levels. Existing benchmarks for GPGPU systems primarily consider performance and are intended only to run at maximum load.
Cloud computing is popular in industry due to its ability to deliver on-demand resources according to a pay-as-you-go model.
Generally, the providers implement an automatic provisioning approach via the virtualization technique. Virtualization makes it possible to rapidly scale the resources up or down. The aforementioned approaches present a reactive method, which is triggered by a certain threshold, such as CPU utilization or memory utilization. Actually, two or more thresholds should be used as a performance metric.
First we propose the elastic resource provisioning (ERP) approach on the performance threshold.
Thus, combining this with an automatic method and a proactive method would be more agile for provisioning the resources. For example, the Elastic VM architecture provisions the resources dynamically to reduce the SLA violation. However, the elasticity is necessary to meet the users’ demand from different perspectives.
To solve the mentioned issues, we propose the ERP approach to provision the resources by the performance threshold, including the CPU and the memory. According to the threshold, we would flexibly scale the resources up or down by considering multiple perspectives. From the perspective of the provider, the goal is aimed at minimizing the amount of the resources to reduce the energy consumption. From the perspective of the users, the goal is aimed at rapidly scaling the resources up or down.
It presents a cost-efficient method to scale up from the perspective of the providers. In contrast, our approach considers more factors to formulate the threshold by the cloud layer model, such as CPU utilization, memory utilization, etc. Additionally, we aim to scale the resources by minimizing the renting cost and response time.
Therefore, it is important to scale the resources from different granularities, including horizontal elasticity and vertical elasticity.
In fact, elasticity is essential to meet a fluctuating workload, and it is necessary to determine the suitable amount of the resources in order to scale the resources.
CloudScale is a system that automates the fine-grained resources in cloud computing infrastructures, determining the adaptive resources by the prediction.
In the automatic policy, the resources would be provisioned and released automatically according to the demand. Generally, the action is triggered by the fixed thresholds, such as the utilization. The common techniques are provided by Amazon and Scalr. However, they provision the resources only based on the utilization, when in fact more elements have taken effect.
PRESS is a predictive elasticity system that analyzes and extracts the workload patterns and provisions the resources automatically.
Automated resource provisioning techniques enable the implementation of elastic services, by adapting the available resources to the service demand. This is essential for reducing power consumption and guaranteeing QoS and SLA fulfillment, especially for those services with strict QoS requirements in terms of latency or response time, such as web servers with high traffic load, data stream processing, or real-time big data analytics. Elasticity is often implemented in cloud platforms and virtualized data-centers by means of auto-scaling mechanisms. These make automated resource provisioning decisions based on the value of specific infrastructure and/or service performance metrics.
On the other hand, service elasticity enables power consumption to be reduced, by avoiding resource over-provisioning.
The auto-scaling mechanisms should allow the system to dynamically adapt to workload changes, by autonomously provisioning and de-provisioning resources (i.e., back-end servers), so that at each point in time, the available resources match the current service demand as closely as possible.
Most control-based systems are reactive mechanisms, for example Lim et al. [30] propose extending the cloud platform with an external feedback controller that enable users to automate the resource provisioning, and introduce the concept of proportional thresholding, a new control policy that takes into account the coarse-grained actuators provided by resource providers.
In contrast to existing works, we propose a non-demand elastic resource provisioning to minimize the overall power consumption of the network (i.e., joint power consumption of the cell sites and VBS pool) while maximizing the resource utilization.
Similar scalability is observed in the sequential read and write workloads. Note that the Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) was set as 9000 to the Virtual SAN network interfaces to get maximum performance for the two disk group configuration for the All Read workload. This is mainly to reduce the CPU utilization consumed by the vSphere network stack at such high loads.
Setting a higher MTU (for example, 9000) may help to get maximum performance for all cached read workloads when using more than one disk group.
This workload can be used to understand the maximum random read I/Os per second (IOPS) that a storage solution can deliver.
In the All Read and Mixed R/W experiments, there are two important metrics to follow: I/Os per second (IOPS) and the mean latency encountered by each I/O operation.
The number of outstanding I/Os is 128 per VM for the All Read workload, and 32 per VM for the Mixed R/W workload.
Cloud storage is typically more reliable, scalable, and secure than traditional on-premises storage systems.

DB instances for Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes for database and log storage.
In some cases, your database workload might not be able to achieve 100 percent of the IOPS that you have provisioned.
Amazon RDS provides three storage types: General Purpose SSD (also known as gp2 and gp3), Provisioned IOPS SSD (also known as io1), and magnetic (also known as standard). They differ in performance characteristics and price, which means that you can tailor your storage performance and cost to the needs of your database workload.
You can create MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and PostgreSQL RDS DB instances with up to 64 tebibytes (TiB) of storage.
Provisioned IOPS storage is designed to meet the needs of I/O-intensive workloads, particularly database workloads, that require low I/O latency and consistent I/O throughput. Provisioned IOPS storage is best suited for production environments.
For every DB engine except RDS for SQL Server, you can provision additional IOPS and storage throughput when storage size is at or above the threshold value. For RDS for SQL Server, you can provision additional IOPS and storage throughput for any available storage size. For all DB engines, you pay for only the additional provisioned storage performance.
If your workload is unpredictable, you can enable storage autoscaling for an Amazon RDS DB instance. To do so, you can use the Amazon RDS console, the Amazon RDS API, or the AWS CLI.
Scaling up database capacity can be a tedious and risky business. Even veteran developers and database administrators who understand the nuanced behavior of their database and application perform this work cautiously. Despite the current era of sharded NoSQL clusters, increasing capacity can take hours, days, or weeks.
It delivers low-latency performance at any scale and greatly simplifies database capacity management.
In June 2017, DynamoDB released auto scaling to make it easier for you to manage capacity efficiently, and auto scaling continues to help DynamoDB users lower the cost of workloads that have a predictable traffic pattern.
When you create a DynamoDB table, auto scaling is the default capacity setting, but you can also enable auto scaling on any table that does not have it active.
It helps you identify and set up key metrics and logs across your application resources and technology stack, such as database, web (IIS) and application servers, operating system, load balancers, and queues.

Amazon EBS provides two volume types: standard volumes and Provisioned IOPS volumes. They differ in performance characteristics and pricing model, allowing you to tailor your storage performance and cost to the needs of your applications. You can attach and stripe across multiple volumes of either type to increase the I/O performance available to your Amazon EC2 applications.
The first cloud data lake for enterprises that is secure, massively scalable and built to the open HDFS standard. With no limits to the size of data and the ability to run massively parallel analytics, you can now unlock value from all your unstructured, semi-structured and structured data.
CouchDB is very customizable and opens the door to developing predictable and performance-driven applications regardless of your data volume or number of users.
If you don’t want to allocate a fixed number of EBS volumes at cluster creation time, use autoscaling local storage.
With autoscaling local storage, Databricks monitors the amount of free disk space available on your cluster’s Spark workers.
If a worker begins to run too low on disk, Databricks automatically attaches a new EBS volume to the worker before it runs out of disk space.
EBS volumes are attached up to a limit of 5 TB of total disk space per instance (including the instance’s local storage).
Your workloads may run more slowly because of the performance impact of reading and writing encrypted data to and from local volumes.
By using Spark's distributed computation engine, the package allows users to run large scale data analysis such as selection, filtering, aggregation from R. Karau et al. (2015) provides a summary of the state-of-the-art on using Spark.
Storage volumes remain available during this scaling-up operation.
OpenSearch Service supports 1 EBS volume (max size of 1.5 TB) per instance associated with a domain. With the default maximum of 20 data nodes allowed per OpenSearch Service domain, you can allocate about 30 TB of EBS storage to a single domain.
If successful, they would like to expand this offering to their consumer line as well, with a much larger volume and a greater market share.
The expansion of IoT, connected devices and people is generating volumes of data that exceed the storage capacity of any traditional database system. This new type of data is often in formats that are not suitable for storing in relational database tables or for querying using relational query semantics.
But as the volume of data continues to grow exponentially, managing backup and recovery and meeting strict protection service-level objectives (SLOs) has become increasingly challenging.
How can companies support 10-1000x increases in query and transaction volumes, leverage 50x as much data for decision making, and do everything that used to take hours or days in seconds or fractions of a second?
Its performance for high volume, low latency transactions and data ingestion exceeds the read and write performance and scalability of traditional databases. Ignite can sit on top of all these databases at the same time as an IMDG and coordinate transactions in-memory with the underlying databases to ensure data is never lost.
PayPal, an eBay company, has used Hadoop and other software tools to detect fraud, but the colossal volumes of data were so large their systems were unable to perform the analysis quickly enough.
The problem is, as data volumes grow, querying against a huge, centrally located data set becomes slow and inefficient, and performance suffers.
And the number of data engineers sought by companies has recently seen a 96% year-over-year change. But hiring alone is not enough to manage the increase in data volume.
An increasing amount of data is generated and collected across machines, enterprises and applications in unstructured or non-relational format. These data types are characterized not just by the large volumes, but also by their velocity, variety and variability. “Data drifting” is a term that is now commonly used to depict the fluctuation in the format, the pace and the content of data in these new data types.
However, high volumes of low cost data on low cost hardware should not be misinterpreted as a signal for reduced service level agreement (SLA) expectations.
Particularly for SAN performance, some storage vendors say that imposing any type of data layout overhead on the data volume reduces performance.
One of the features of Data ONTAP that NetApp users consistently comment on is the ability to nondisruptively grow and shrink data volumes as needs change. For example, you can provision a data volume for use with either NAS or SAN protocols and grow it over time to meet changing needs.
A higher priority gives a volume a greater percentage of available resources when a system is fully loaded.
Analogous to the clustering of multiple database servers in Oracle® Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC), storage resources across multiple storage controllers can be employed to deliver much greater I/O performance to an application than a single storage controller could achieve alone.
For example, Leuven University Hospital (UZ Leuven) consolidated all its critical Sybase database storage along with storage used by less critical SQL Server applications on a single set of NetApp storage systems.
Big Data requires processing high volumes of low-density data, that is, data of unknown value, such as twitter data feeds, clicks on a web page, network traffic, sensor-enabled equipment capturing data at the speed of light, and many more. It is the task of Big Data to convert low-density data into high-density data, that is, data that has value. For some companies, this might be tens of terabytes, for others it may be hundreds of petabytes.
By leveraging Oracle Exadata for your data warehouse, processing can be enhanced with flash memory, columnar databases, in-memory databases, and more.
Oracle NoSQL Database is designed as a highly scalable, distributed database based on Oracle Berkeley DB. Sleepycat Software. Oracle NoSQL Database is a general purpose, enterprise class key value store that adds an intelligent driver on top of an enhanced distributed Berkeley database.
Spark or MapReduce processing of high volume, high variety data from multiple data sources and then reduce and optimize dataset to calculate risk profiles.
Its performance for high volume, low latency transactions and data ingestion exceeds the read and write performance and scalability of traditional databases.
An Ignite cluster can also be used as a distributed, transactional IMDB to support high volume, low latency transactions, and data ingestion, or for low-cost storage.
Kafka on your own, you need to provision servers, configure Apache Kafka manually, replace servers when they fail, orchestrate server patches and upgrades, architect the cluster for high availability, ensure data is durably stored and secured, set up monitoring and alarms, and carefully plan scaling events to support load changes.
It automates most of the common administrative tasks associated with provisioning, configuring, monitoring, backing up, and securing a data warehouse, making it easy and inexpensive to manage and maintain. This automation enables you to build petabyte-scale data warehouses in minutes instead of weeks or months.
Several teams of scientists run complex applications to analyze subsets of those huge volumes of data.
When the volume of data to be analyzed is of the order of terabytes or petabytes (billions of tweets or posts), scalable storage and computing solutions must be used, but no clear solutions today exist for the analysis of Exascale datasets.
Indeed, processing very large data volumes requires operations and new algorithms able to scale in loading, storing, and processing massive amounts of data that generally must be partitioned in very small data grains, on which thousands to millions of simple parallel operations do analysis.
Moving to social media applications, nowadays the huge volume of user-generated data in social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, are very precious sources of data from which to extract insights concerning human dynamics and behaviors.
In-memory querying and analytics needed to reduce query response times and execution of analytics operations by caching large volumes of data in the computing node RAMs and issuing queries and other operation in parallel on the main memory of computing nodes.
As Exascale systems are likely to be based on large distributed memory hardware, MPI is one of the most natural programming systems.
On the other side, we have shared-memory models where the major system is OpenMP that offers a simple parallel programming model although it does not provide mechanisms to explicitly map and control data distribution and includes non-scalable synchronization operations that are making very challenging its implementation on massively parallel systems.
General issues like energy consumption, multitasking, scheduling, reproducibility, and resiliency must be addressed together with other data-oriented issues like data distribution and mapping, data access, data communication and synchronization.
ata locality mechanisms/constructs, like near-data computing must be designed and evaluated on big data applications when subsets of data are stored in nearby processors and by avoiding that locality is imposed when data must be moved. Other challenges concern data affinity control data querying (NoSQL approach), global data distribution and sharing patterns.
In order to resolve the contradiction between requirements of high performance and limited memory resource, we propose a scalable Main-Memory database system ScaMMDB which distributes data and operations to several nodes and makes good use of every node’s resource.
Napa: Powering Scalable Data Warehousing with Robust Query Performance at Google.
We need to store and serve these planet-scale data sets under extremely demanding requirements of scalability, sub-second query response times, availability even in the case of entire data center failures, strong consistency guarantees, ingesting a massive stream of updates coming from the applications used around the globe. We have developed and deployed in production an analytical data management system, called Napa, to meet these requirements.
At its core, Napa’s principal technologies for robust query performance include the aggressive use of materialized views that are maintained consistently as new data is ingested across multiple data centers. Our clients also demand flexibility in being able to adjust their query performance, data freshness, and costs to suit their unique needs. Robust query processing and flexible configuration of client databases are the hallmark of Napa design.
Charged with serving as the Federal lifeline for millions of citizens who need immediate help in the face of life-threatening disasters, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is working with Google Cloud services to run its data management system more efficiently, securely, and collaboratively.
The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) STRIDES program and NCI Imaging Data Commons are using Google Cloud to help accelerate research productivity with purpose built, scalable data management tools.
NEON was designed for the grand challenges in ecology and Paula Mabee shared how they are partnering with Google to collect and manage over 400 terabytes of raw data per year across 182 data products to accelerate discoveries and help get these important data and knowledge to the into the hands of scientists and decision makers.
In some DevOps models, quality assurance and security teams may also become more tightly integrated with development and operations and throughout the application lifecycle. When security is the focus of everyone on a DevOps team, this is sometimes referred to as DevSecOps.
These teams use practices to automate processes that historically have been manual and slow. They use a technology stack and tooling which help them operate and evolve applications quickly and reliably. These tools also help engineers independently accomplish tasks (for example, deploying code or provisioning infrastructure) that normally would have required help from other teams, and this further increases a team’s velocity.
The DevOps model enables your developers and operations teams to achieve these results. For example, microservices and continuous delivery let teams take ownership of services and then release updates to them quicker.
Increase the frequency and pace of releases so you can innovate and improve your product faster. The quicker you can release new features and fix bugs, the faster you can respond to your customers’ needs and build competitive advantage. Continuous integration and continuous delivery are practices that automate the software release process, from build to deploy.
Ensure the quality of application updates and infrastructure changes so you can reliably deliver at a more rapid pace while maintaining a positive experience for end users. Use practices like continuous integration and continuous delivery to test that each change is functional and safe. Monitoring and logging practices help you stay informed of performance in real-time.
Operate and manage your infrastructure and development processes at scale. Automation and consistency help you manage complex or changing systems efficiently and with reduced risk. For example, infrastructure as code helps you manage your development, testing, and production environments in a repeatable and more efficient manner.
Developers and operations teams collaborate closely, share many responsibilities, and combine their workflows. This reduces inefficiencies and saves time (e.g. reduced handover periods between developers and operations, writing code that takes into account the environment in which it is run).
Continuous integration is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. The key goals of continuous integration are to find and address bugs quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.
Infrastructure as code is a practice in which infrastructure is provisioned and managed using code and software development techniques, such as version control and continuous integration. The cloud’s API-driven model enables developers and system administrators to interact with infrastructure programmatically, and at scale, instead of needing to manually set up and configure resources. Thus, engineers can interface with infrastructure using code-based tools and treat infrastructure in a manner similar to how they treat application code. Because they are defined by code, infrastructure and servers can quickly be deployed using standardized patterns, updated with the latest patches and versions, or duplicated in repeatable ways.
AWS customers are welcome to carry out security assessments or penetration tests of their AWS infrastructure without prior approval for the services listed in the next section under “Permitted Services.” Additionally, AWS permits customers to host their security assessment tooling within the AWS IP space or other cloud provider for on-prem, in AWS, or third party contracted testing. All security testing that includes Command and Control (C2) requires prior approval.
AWS's policy regarding the use of security assessment tools and services allows significant flexibility for performing security assessments of your AWS assets while protecting other AWS customers and ensuring quality-of-service across AWS.
The term "security assessment" refers to all activity engaged in for the purposes of determining the efficacy or existence of security controls amongst your AWS assets, e.g., port-scanning, vulnerability scanning/checks, penetration testing, exploitation, web application scanning, as well as any injection, forgery, or fuzzing activity, either performed remotely against your AWS assets, amongst/between your AWS assets, or locally within the virtualized assets themselves.
Customers wishing to perform a DDoS simulation test should review our DDoS Simulation Testing policy.
With Model Monitor, you can set alerts that notify you when there are deviations in the model quality.
Early and proactive detection of these deviations enables you to take corrective actions, such as retraining models, auditing upstream systems, or fixing quality issues without having to monitor models manually or build additional tooling.
In this blog post, we introduce Deequ, an open source tool developed and used at Amazon. Deequ allows you to calculate data quality metrics on your dataset, define and verify data quality constraints, and be informed about changes in the data distribution.
AWS’s strategy for design and development of AWS services is to clearly define services in terms of customer use cases, service performance, marketing and distribution requirements, production and testing, and legal and regulatory requirements.
AWS implements formal, documented policies and procedures that provide guidance for operations and information security within the organization and the supporting AWS environments. Policies address purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities and management commitment. All policies are maintained in a centralized location that is accessible by employees.
The AWS quality system is documented to ensure that planning is consistent with all other requirements.
AWS continuously monitors service usage to project infrastructure needs to support availability commitments and requirements. AWS maintains a capacity planning model to assess infrastructure usage and demands at least monthly, and usually more frequently. In addition, the AWS capacity planning model supports the planning of future demands to acquire and implement additional resources based upon current resources and forecasted requirements.
AWS offers commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) IT services according to IT quality and security standards such as ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, ISO 9001, NIST 800-53 and many others.
It's important to run controlled tests and monitor the same environment or workstation as those reporting the issue, and be able to reproduce the same use cases. Consider the following general testing recommendations for measuring and gathering data to investigate voice quality issues.
To ensure the ultimate level of security, you need to integrate health checks into your workflow, and DevOps is the best method of achieving this goal. Amazon Inspector is one of the AWS tools for testers that is delivered as a service that facilitates an easier adoption into the existing DevOps process. DevSecOps extends DevOps with QA and entails continuous communication among operational teams, developers, and testers.
We can help you integrate continuous testing into your pipeline, eliminate human errors, and automate deployments. In our experience, going through test automation implementation helps companies to validate their current QA processes and improve test accuracy. Finally, test automation services reduces time-to-market and delivers a high-quality product with fewer bugs.
The modern tools and techniques of application validation can simplify the testing process, shorten time-to-market, keep money in the budget, and enhance product quality.
To begin reviewing code, you can associate your existing code repositories on GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, Bitbucket, or AWS CodeCommit in the CodeGuru console.
We have about 300+ microservices right now that are being reviewed and managed by CodeGuru Reviewer.
Incorporating CodeGuru in our development workflows improves and automates code reviews, helps our DevOps teams proactively identify and fix functional and non-functional issues and ensures that the deployments exceeds the performance, security and compliance requirements of our customers across industries and regions.
With CodeGuru, we have built automated code reviews directly into our pipelines, which means my team can deploy code faster and with more confidence. We use CodeGuru Reviewer’s recommendations based on ML and automated reasoning, to focus on fixing and improving the code, instead of manually finding flaws. The addition of Python has made CodeGuru even more accessible for us.
Amazon CodeGuru has helped expedite our software development lifecycle by streamlining the code review process. As the primary code reviewer on the team, I can now focus more on the functionality and feature implementation of the code as opposed to searching for security vulnerabilities and best practices that may not have been followed.
Integrate CodeGuru into your existing software development workflow to automate code reviews during application development and continuously monitor application's performance in production and provide recommendations and visual clues on how to improve code quality, application performance, and reduce overall cost.
The software development starts with design documents and reviews, and moves through code reviews. A security review will be conducted by both the independent AWS Security team as well as the Amazon EC2 engineering team for significant changes or features.
Once code reviews and approvals are complete, and all automated checks are passed, our automated package deployment process takes over. As part of this automated deployment pipeline, binary artifacts are built and teams run end-to-end, validation, and security-specific tests. If any type of validation fails, the deployment process is halted until the issue is remediated.
If a package is not included as part of a validated system, then by implication it is not approved for use within the controlled environment. If the environment permits a user to install their own packages the onus would be on the user to take extra precautions to ensure that it behaves as expected for their specific use case. In all cases, it is expected that users would follow their internal Quality Assurance Standard Operating Procedures.
Oracle is uniquely positioned and qualified to deliver and support open source software by eliminating risk through supporting the binaries from open source projects. In addition, Oracle implements rigorous methodology and proven processes to ensure that the open source software meets or exceeds specifications by subjecting it to the same standards, quality assurance, and interoperability testing as Oracle’s commercial software.
Our dedicated security team includes some of the world's foremost experts in information security, application security, cryptography, and network security. This team maintains our defense systems, develops security review processes, builds security infrastructure, and implements our security policies. The team actively scans for security threats using commercial and custom tools. The team also conducts penetration tests and performs quality assurance and security reviews.
At a high level, cloud-native architecture means adapting to the many new possibilities—but very different set of architectural constraints—offered by the cloud compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure.
While the functional aspects don't change too much, the cloud offers, and sometimes requires, very different ways to meet non-functional requirements, and imposes very different architectural constraints. If architects fail to adapt their approach to these different constraints, the systems they architect are often fragile, expensive, and hard to maintain. A well-architected cloud native system, on the other hand, should be largely self-healing, cost efficient, and easily updated and maintained through Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD).
Automation has always been a best practice for software systems, but cloud makes it easier than ever to automate the infrastructure as well as components that sit above it.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery: Automate the build, testing, and deployment of the packages that make up the system by using tools like Google Cloud Build, Jenkins and Spinnaker. Not only should you automate the deployment, you should strive to automate processes like canary testing and rollback.
Scale up and scale down: Unless your system load almost never changes, you should automate the scale up of the system in response to increases in load, and scale down in response to sustained drops in load. By scaling up, you ensure your service remains available, and by scaling down you reduce costs.
Monitoring and automated recovery: You should bake monitoring and logging into your cloud-native systems from inception. Logging and monitoring data streams can naturally be used for monitoring the health of the system, but can have many uses beyond this.
This means that almost all of the principles of good architectural design still apply for cloud-native architecture.
In this post we set out five principles of cloud-native architecture that will help to ensure your designs take full advantage of the cloud while avoiding the pitfalls of shoe-horning old approaches into a new platform.
The largest design constraint for the implementation of the project is financial.
Resources can be provisioned as temporary, disposable units, freeing users from the inflexibility and constraints of a fixed and finite IT infrastructure.
Multi-objective optimizations were performed based on actual design constraints.
Optimal solutions identified for differing design constraints in a short time.
To investigate this question, we first present and formalize the design constraints for building an autonomous driving system in terms of performance, predictability, storage, thermal and power.
With accelerator-based designs, we are able to build an end-to-end autonomous driving system that meets all the design constraints, and explore the trade-offs among performance, power and the higher accuracy enabled by higher resolution cameras.
The solution architect must understand all these constraints, compare them, and then make a number of technological and managerial decisions to reconcile these restrictions with project goals.
Among all the practices that SLSA and NIST SSDF promote, using application-level security scanning as part of continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) systems for production releases was the most common practice, with 63% of respondents saying this was “very” or “completely” established. Preserving code history and using build scripts are also highly established, while signing metadata and requiring a two-person review process have the most room for growth.
To that end, the data indicate that organizational culture and modern development processes (such as continuous integration) are the biggest drivers of an organization’s software security and are the best place to start for organizations looking to improve their security posture.
Today, we are honored to share that Cloud Build, Google Cloud’s continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) platform, was named a Leader in The Forrester Wave™: Cloud-Native Continuous Integration Tools, Q3 2019. The report identifies the 10 CI providers that matter most for continuous integration (CI) and how they stack up on 27 criterias.
Lighthouse CI shows how these findings have changed over time. This can be used to identify the impact of particular code changes or ensure that performance thresholds are met during continuous integration processes. Although performance monitoring is the most common use case for Lighthouse CI, it can be used to monitor other aspects of the Lighthouse report - for example, SEO or accessibility.
Speed, Scale, And Security Are The Important Differentiators As organizations transition to continuous delivery (CD) and shift hosting of production workloads to cloud servers, traditional, on-premises continuous integration will no longer suffice. Cloud-native CI products with exceptional build speed, on-demand scale, and secure configurations will lead the market and enable customers to accelerate delivery speed and lower management costs, all while meeting corporate compliance needs.
Continuous integration (CI) systems automate the compilation, building, and testing of software. Despite CI rising as a big success story in automated software engineering, it has received almost no attention from the research community.
Continuous Integration (CI) is emerging as one of the biggest success stories in automated software engineering. CI systems automate the compilation, building, testing and deployment of software.
This document discusses techniques for implementing and automating continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), and continuous training (CT) for machine learning (ML) systems.
This document is for data scientists and ML engineers who want to apply DevOps principles to ML systems (MLOps). MLOps is an ML engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying ML system development (Dev) and ML system operation (Ops). Practicing MLOps means that you advocate for automation and monitoring at all steps of ML system construction, including integration, testing, releasing, deployment and infrastructure management.
Testing an ML system is more involved than testing other software systems. In addition to typical unit and integration tests, you need data validation, trained model quality evaluation, and model validation.
ML and other software systems are similar in continuous integration of source control, unit testing, integration testing, and continuous delivery of the software module or the package.
You build source code and run various tests. The outputs of this stage are pipeline components (packages, executables, and artifacts) to be deployed in a later stage.
In this level, your system continuously delivers new pipeline implementations to the target environment that in turn delivers prediction services of the newly trained model. For rapid and reliable continuous delivery of pipelines and models, you should consider the following:
Rather, it means deploying an ML pipeline that can automate the retraining and deployment of new models. Setting up a CI/CD system enables you to automatically test and deploy new pipeline implementations. This system lets you cope with rapid changes in your data and business environment.
You can gradually implement these practices to help improve the automation of your ML system development and production.
The goal of level 1 is to perform continuous training of the model by automating the ML pipeline; this lets you achieve continuous delivery of model prediction service. To automate the process of using new data to retrain models in production, you need to introduce automated data and model validation steps to the pipeline, as well as pipeline triggers and metadata management.
Continuous delivery of models: An ML pipeline in production continuously delivers prediction services to new models that are trained on new data. The model deployment step, which serves the trained and validated model as a prediction service for online predictions, is automated.
Therefore, automated data validation and model validation steps are required in the production pipeline to ensure the following expected behavior:
An optional additional component for level 1 ML pipeline automation is a feature store.
For a rapid and reliable update of the pipelines in production, you need a robust automated CI/CD system. This automated CI/CD system lets your data scientists rapidly explore new ideas around feature engineering, model architecture, and hyperparameters. They can implement these ideas and automatically build, test, and deploy the new pipeline components to the target environment.
Network automation substantially increases network efficiency to lower the cost per bit and maximize profit.
Over the past decade, Arista has been delivering cloud networking solutions with a unique software-driven approach to building reliable networks designed around the principles of standardization, simplification, cost-savings, and automation.
While hyper-scale cloud operators drove much of the new technologies and systems that they used to build their infrastructure, most enterprises do not have the time, skillset, or resources to build out their own homegrown cloud automation platform.
Modern network architectures require a system approach with real-time automation, using open state-streaming APIs for continuous real-time synchronization of network state and configuration, and providing advanced AI/ML analytics to provide instantaneous compliance, visibility, and troubleshooting.
DevOps CI/CD Model. This model is typically deployed by relatively large service providers or enterprises, as they embark on an automation journey. Their approach includes using automation frameworks – typically also being used by the DevOps compute and platform operations teams – such as Hashicorp Terraform or Red Hat Ansible to automate the provisioning of the network infrastructure and to drive down OpEx costs. These customers have the resources and skills to write their own custom scripts and are invested in DevOps automation approaches with committed resources. Arista supports these customers by providing open software integration into DevOps frameworks like Terraform, Ansible, Puppet, and Chef, as well as supporting streaming receiver platforms like ELK stack, Prometheus, and others.
CloudVision is a modern, multi-domain network management platform built on cloud networking principles for telemetry, analytics, and automation.
Visual Studio Team System (VSTS) 2010 introduces new features and capabilities to help agile teams with planning. In this article I will introduce you to the new product backlog and iteration backlog workbooks and a set of new reports that will help agile teams plan and manage releases and iterations.
Agile supports Agile planning methods (learn more about Agile methodologies at the Agile Alliance), including Scrum, and tracks development and test activities separately. This process works great if you want to track user stories and (optionally) bugs on the Kanban board, or track bugs and tasks on the Taskboard.
Scrum tracks work using product backlog items (PBIs) and bugs on the Kanban board or viewed on a sprint Taskboard.
Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) supports a framework for process improvement and an auditable record of decisions. With this process, you can track requirements, change requests, risks, and reviews. This process supports formal change management activities.
Azure Boards offers predefined work item types for tracking features, user stories, bugs, and tasks, making it easy to start using your product backlog or Kanban board. It supports different Agile methods, so you can implement the method that suits you best. You can add teams as your organization grows to give them the autonomy to track their work as they see fit.
For example, if you update a record in Microsoft Azure DevOps, the update is reflected in Agile Development. Similarly, if you update a record in Agile Development, the update is reflected in Microsoft Azure DevOps.
The Integration of Microsoft Azure DevOps with Agile Development enables you to do the following: View available Microsoft Azure DevOps projects in Agile Development. Perform a bulk import of records from Microsoft Azure DevOps to Agile Development. Perform single record updates between Microsoft Azure DevOps and Agile Development. Avoid duplicating record update entries in Microsoft Azure DevOps and Agile Development.
Plan, track, and update your tasks from a single application.
Consider managing your bug bar and technical debt as part of your team's overall set of continuous improvement activities. You may find these resources of interest:
While bugs contribute to technical debt, they may not represent all debt.
Poor software design, poorly written code, or short-term fixes can all contribute to technical debt. Technical debt reflects extra development work that arises from all these problems.
Track work to address technical debt as PBIs, user stories, or bugs. To track a team's progress in incurring and addressing technical debt, you'll want to consider how to categorize the work item and the details you want to track.
Good Scrum Masters have or develop excellent communication, negotiation, and conflict resolution skills.
The diagram below details the iterative Scrum lifecycle. The entire lifecycle is completed in fixed time periods called sprints. A sprint is typically one-to-four weeks long.
The Scrum master ensures that the Scrum process is followed by the team. Scrum masters are continually on the lookout for how the team can improve, while also resolving impediments and other blocking issues that arise during the sprint. Scrum masters are part coach, part team member, and part cheerleader.
The members of the Scrum team actually build the product. The team owns the engineering of the product, and the quality that goes with it.
In sprint planning, the team chooses backlog items to work on in the upcoming sprint. The team chooses backlog items based on priority and what they believe they can complete in the sprint. The sprint backlog is the list of items the team plans to deliver in the sprint. Often, each item on the sprint backlog is broken down into tasks. Once all members agree the sprint backlog is achievable, the sprint starts.
The entire cycle is repeated for the next sprint. Sprint planning selects the next items on the product backlog and the cycle repeats. While the team executes the sprint, the product owner ensures the items at the top of the backlog are ready to execute in the following sprint.
Alleviate technical debt with IT modernization that works.
Even so, organizations have invested money, time, and training in their existing infrastructure and need to maximize its value and return. This technical debt often leaves little budget and time for innovation.
Modernizing your applications and other elements of your IT environment can help reduce technical debt in your current infrastructure and free time and budget for strategic projects that support business initiatives.
Technical debt refers to the side effects of prioritising time, money, and workarounds over quality in the delivery of enterprise IT.
Plan an integrated organisation-wide approach to remediation; review and update often. Consider the aspects of technical debt that you may be introducing with every new “go live” .
IDC predicts that through 2023, coping with technical debt accumulated during the pandemic will challenge 50% of CIOs. This technical debt is a result of what were imperative but necessarily fast-tracked implementations of solutions for new, remote working arrangements after the onset of COVID-19.
Investing in right sizing enterprise cloud environments and integrating these with older stop-gap solutions will help minimise the burden of technical debt.
Technical debt is a metaphor that is defined as the result of an IT departments preference to taking shortcuts using basic techniques comma not considering long-term consequences when developing and implementing code comma and delaying the upgrade of infrastructure on a timely basis.
Utilizing Legacy software development platforms that require a high number of lines of code versus rapid application development platforms Legacy platforms generate technical debt due to their coding complexity in the Labor standardization while rapid application development platforms bracket such as a low code or no code bracket provide a visual development approach which can save up to 40 to 50% of coding effort.
Azure and Digital Transformation: Modernize Apps, Boost Agility, and Pay Down Technical Debt.
Technical debt is a well-known problem in software development. But in complex, user-facing software like rich text editors, technical debt isn’t the only problem.
Generally, when you’re tracking and prioritising technical debt work, engineering mostly focuses on non-optimal code — or short-term implementation shortcuts — used to deliver a project faster.
User satisfaction, value delivered and product marketability are as dependent on UI/UX as performance, and that’s where functional debt poses a threat. And similarly to technical debt, functional debt is hard to identify and pay down.
Technical debt is about how a feature was implemented.
Rich text editors are inherently complex, with busy feature roadmaps, which creates an environment where both technical and functional debt rapidly accrue.
Here’s three of the many phases we worked through with the TinyMCE core engine, when identifying, prioritising, tracking and paying down our technical debt.
As manual processes are digitized and automated, operational overheads and protocols only increase complexity and technical debt, resulting in applications and networks that incur hidden costs and unexpected externalities.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software. in detail, the SDLC methodology focuses on the following phases of software development:
SDLC or the Software Development Life Cycle is a process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time possible. SDLC provides a well-structured flow of phases that help an organization to quickly produce high-quality software which is well-tested and ready for production use.
It’s also important to know that there is a strong focus on the testing phase. As the SDLC is a repetitive methodology, you have to ensure code quality at every cycle. Many organizations tend to spend few efforts on testing while a stronger focus on testing can save them a lot of rework, time, and money. Be smart and write the right types of tests.
Application performance monitoring (APM) tools can be used in a development, QA, and production environment. This keeps everyone using the same toolset across the entire development lifecycle.
The Agile SDLC model separates the product into cycles and delivers a working product very quickly. This methodology produces a succession of releases. Testing of each release feeds back info that’s incorporated into the next version.
IBM Engineering Lifecycle Management (ELM) is the leading platform for today’s complex product and software development. ELM extends the functionality of standard ALM tools, providing an integrated, end-to-end solution that offers full transparency and traceability across all engineering data.

Every phase of the SDLC life Cycle has its own process and deliverables that feed into the next phase. SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle and is also referred to as the Application Development life-cycle.
Once the system design phase is over, the next phase is coding. In this phase, developers start build the entire system by writing code using the chosen programming language. In the coding phase, tasks are divided into units or modules and assigned to the various developers. It is the longest phase of the Software Development Life Cycle process.
The SDLC life cycle process is repeated, with each release adding more functionality until all requirements are met. In this method, every cycle act as the maintenance phase for the previous software release. Modification to the incremental model allows development cycles to overlap. After that subsequent cycle may begin before the previous cycle is complete.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process for building software that ensures the quality and correctness of the software built.
The full form SDLC is Software Development Life Cycle or Systems Development Life Cycle.
The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software. The goal of SDLC is to minimize project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond. This methodology outlines a series of steps that divide the software development process into tasks you can assign, complete, and measure.
The software development lifecycle (SDLC) outlines several tasks required to build a software application. The development process goes through several stages as developers add new features and fix bugs in the software.
A software development lifecycle (SDLC) model conceptually presents SDLC in an organized fashion to help organizations implement it. Different models arrange the SDLC phases in varying chronological order to optimize the development cycle. We look at some popular SDLC models below.
Rapid development cycles help teams identify and address issues in complex projects early on and before they become significant problems. They can also engage customers and stakeholders to obtain feedback throughout the project lifecycle.
DevSecOps is the practice of integrating security testing at every stage of the software development process. It includes tools and processes that encourage collaboration between developers, security specialists, and operation teams to build software that can withstand modern threats. In addition, it ensures that security assurance activities such as code review, architecture analysis, and penetration testing are integral to development efforts.
Having achieved some understanding of the Project Management and System Development lifecycles, and having learned to discern relative value of their multitudinous deliverables, we are now well positioned to come up with a sequence of milestones that can communicate the status of the project in a fashion meaningful to the Project and Executive Sponsor layers of the organization.
However, many organizations still lag behind when it comes to building security into their software development life cycle (SDLC).
The later a bug is found in the SDLC, the more expensive it becomes to fix. When a bug is found late in the cycle, developers must drop the work they are doing, and go back to revisit code they may have written weeks ago. Even worse, when a bug is found in production, the code gets sent all the way back to the beginning of the SDLC.
Many secure SDLC models are in use, but one of the best known is the Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (MS SDL), which outlines 12 practices organizations can adopt to increase the security of their software. There is also the Secure Software Development Framework from the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST), which focuses on security-related processes that organizations can integrate into their existing SDLC.
PowerApps canvas app coding standards and guidelines.
It contains standards for naming objects, collections, and variables, and guidelines for developing consistent, performant, and easily maintainable apps.
This white paper was developed as a collaboration between the Microsoft PowerApps team, Microsoft IT, and industry professionals. Of course, enterprise customers are free to develop their own standards and practices. However, we feel that adherence to these guidelines will help developers in these areas:
We brought our own PowerApps experience and knowledge, and spoke with expert PowerApps makers across the world to collect their standards and best practices and bring them together in this document.
The standards and guidelines are targeted at the enterprise application maker (developer) who is responsible for designing, building, testing, deploying, and maintaining PowerApps apps in a small business, corporate, or government environment.
As we mention in the white paper, these coding standards and guidelines are flexible and serve as a starting point for organizations to develop their own standards. This white paper is intended to be a living document.
Coding standards are collections of coding rules, guidelines, and best practices. Using the right one — such as C coding standards and C++ coding standards — will help you write cleaner code.
Here we explain why coding standards (such as C coding standards) are important, so consider this your guide to finding and using coding rules and guidelines.
Using C coding standards is a smart way to find undefined and unpredictable behaviors.
Adoption and management of coding standards (e.g. MISRA) at large scale in complex codebases.
The standard is comprised of 12 parts that span the breadth of the automotive safety lifecycle including management, development, production, operation service, and decommissioning.
Static code analysis to identify coding standards and security vulnerabilities during development (Appendix E.3.3).
Synopsys is also involved as a member in formulating the SAE J3061 and ISO 21434 standards, which define comprehensive strategies for automotive cybersecurity.
Custom coding rules can be authored for specific API or organizational coding standards as required using the Code XM extension framework.
While coding standards such as MISRA will restrict the available concurrency functions available for use, Coverity includes a number of built-in checks specifically targeted at finding concurrency related errors including deadlocks, resource exhaustion, and inconsistent usage of locking and thread management routines.
Once the architectural design is complete, the next stage in the ISO 26262 standard is software unit design and implementation.
The standard supplies numerous guidelines for software design and implementation to ensure the correct order of execution, consistency of interfaces, correctness of data flow and control flow, simplicity, readability and comprehensibility, and robustness.
During development, Synopsys enables developers to ensure that their code conforms to ISO 26262 design principles. This is accomplished primarily by implementing industry-specific coding standards rules such as MISRA C/C++.
Now, three years post-implementation, AHIMA is defining a “new normal” by establishing ICD-10-CM/PCS coding productivity benchmarks. To do so, several building blocks have been created, to be followed by an AHIMA-led systemic, highly credible study resulting in the standard for coding productivity.
February 2016, coding productivity was at approximately 50 percent of the standard established in 2007, about 40 minutes (or 1.5 records per hour).
Such changes in the health environment will be taken into account as AHIMA proceeds toward an updated coding productivity standard.
Overall, AHIMA has provided multiple coding standard examples for ICD-10-CM/PCS for inpatient records.

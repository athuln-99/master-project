If our customers and partners do not have access to highly skilled and trained users of our platform, our customers may not be able to unlock the full potential of our platform, customer satisfaction may suffer, and our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects may be adversely affected.
I am proud that Anaplan delivered a very strong fourth quarter and finished the year with over 1,900 customers.
If we experience a security incident affecting our platform, networks, systems or data or the data of our customers, or are perceived to have experienced such a security incident, our platform may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our platform, we may incur significant liabilities, and our business could be materially adversely affected.
Enterprise customers can upload data to the Anaplan cloud, letting the customer's business users organize and analyze disparate sets of enterprise data from finance, human resources, sales and other business units.
Revise the access of each user and set ‘No Access’ if that user is no longer using the model. Setting ‘No Access’ will reduce the cell count of a module where the User list is being used.
Begin by revisiting all the tabs in the User Access setting and set appropriate access by roles. A common mistake is granting full access to all roles, even though a specific role shouldn't have access to this complete level of items.
Give access only to the roles which need to add/remove/edit items in that list. It is best practice not to give access to the list for all the roles.
Breaking up the models mitigates the risk that someone accidentally was given inappropriate access by keeping finance partners in their own planning model (PBF), hiring managers in their own model (this is the largest user base in the process), and human resources and recruiting planning in their existing recruiting management model.
Lefouet said Anaplan was on track to sign up 150,000 users this year, and should triple that number in 2016, putting it in reach of 1 million users by 2017 or 2018, he said. By contrast, SAP and Oracle count tens of million of cloud software users, although these numbers include a far broader set of products.
While Anaplan, now based in San Francisco, could consider an initial public offering (IPO) in the coming year, it is focused on its next milestone of signing up 1 million users, or an average of 1,000 users across 1,000 global accounts, Lefouet said.
Anaplan offers users a cloud-based service that processes billions of spreadsheet cells of corporate data on central computers, then illustrates the results in charts and graphics within a user’s web browser.
The company can now show its corporate customers when and where their employees log in to Anaplan, and how long they used it, on a dashboard.

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling supports the following types of dynamic scaling policies:
Step scaling—Increase and decrease the current capacity of the group based on a set of scaling adjustments, known as step adjustments, that vary based on the size of the alarm breach.
Simple scaling—Increase and decrease the current capacity of the group based on a single scaling adjustment, with a cooldown period between each scaling activity.
If you are scaling based on a metric that increases or decreases proportionally to the number of instances in an Auto Scaling group, we recommend that you use target tracking scaling policies. Otherwise, we recommend that you use step scaling policies.
When you use an Auto Scaling group without any form of dynamic scaling, it doesn't scale on its own unless you set up scheduled scaling or predictive scaling.
When the desired capacity reaches the maximum size limit, scaling out stops. If demand drops and capacity decreases, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can scale out again.
An Auto Scaling group has a maximum capacity of 12, a current capacity of 10, and a dynamic scaling policy that adds 5 capacity units.
NoSQL cloud database services, like Amazon DynamoDB, are popular for their simple key-value operations, unbounded scalability and predictable low-latency. Atomic transactions, while popular in relational databases, carry the specter of complexity and low performance, especially when used for workloads with high contention. Transactions often have been viewed as inherently incompatible with NoSQL stores, and the few commercial services that combine both come with limitations. This talk examines the tension between transactions and non-relational databases, and it recounts my journey of adding transactions to DynamoDB.

Load balancing enables scalability, avoids bottlenecks and also reduces time taken to give the respond. Many load balancing algorithm [2] have been designed in order to schedule the load among various machines. But so far there is no such ideal load balancing algorithm has been developed which will allocate the load evenly across the system.
This simply means that the software intelligent load balancers are also used to provide actionable insights to an organization. In this section, we look at how routing is done in SDN to facilitate for intelligent load balancing. In order to appreciate the power of intelligent load balancing routing in SDN and its advantages, we first cover a summary of load balancing routing in IP networks.
Load unbalancing problem is a multi-variant, multi-constraint problem that degrades performance and efficiency of computing resources. Load balancing techniques cater the solution for load unbalancing situation for two undesirable facets- overloading and under-loading.
Recent advances in programmable data planes, software-defined networking, and the adoption of IPv6, support novel, more complex load balancing strategies.
It has sustained the rapid global growth of Google services, and it also provides network load balancing for Google Cloud Platform.
We’ll discuss Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB) as a concrete example of large-scale load balancing, but nearly all of the best practices we describe also apply to other cloud providers’ load balancers.
If your system becomes sufficiently complex, you may need to use more than one kind of load management. For example, you might run several managed instance groups that scale with load but are cloned across multiple regions for capacity; therefore, you also need to balance traffic between regions. In this case, your system needs to use both load balancing and load-based autoscaling.
If your site gets popular on social media and suddenly experiences a five-fold increase in traffic, you’d prefer to serve what requests you can. Therefore, you implement load shedding to drop excess traffic. In this case, your system needs to use both load balancing and load shedding.
In brief, the load balancer didn’t know that the “efficient” requests were errors because the load shedding and load balancing systems weren’t communicating. Each system was added and enabled separately, likely by different engineers. No one had examined them as one unified load management system.
Autoscaling is a powerful tool, but it’s easy to get wrong. Unless carefully configured, autoscaling can result in disastrous consequences—for example, potentially catastrophic feedback cycles between load balancing, load shedding, and autoscaling when these tools are configured in isolation. As the Pokémon GO case study illustrates, traffic management works best when it’s based upon a holistic view of the interactions between systems.
Time and time again, we’ve seen that no amount of load shedding, autoscaling, or throttling will save our services when they all fail in sync.
Several techniques have been reported in the literature to improve performance and resource use based on load balancing, task scheduling, resource management, quality of service, and workload management. Load balancing in the cloud allows data centers to avoid overloading/underloading in virtual machines, which itself is a challenge in the field of cloud computing. Therefore, it becomes a necessity for developers and researchers to design and implement a suitable load balancer for parallel and distributed cloud environments.
Currently, load balancing in the cloud (LBC) is one of the main challenges that allows avoiding the situation of overloading/underloading in virtual machines during task computation.
Thus, there is a need to identify the issues that affect LBC and develop an effective load balancing technique for cloud environments.
Load balancing provides the facility to distribute the workload equally on available resources. Its objective is to provide continuous service in case of failure of any service’s component by provisioning and deprovisioning the application instances along with proper utilization of resources.
load balancing, there are various challenges, such as resource scheduling, performance monitoring, QoS management, energy consumption, and service availability in the cloud.
OLTP or Online Transaction Processing is a type of data processing that consists of executing a number of transactions occurring concurrently—online banking, shopping, order entry, or sending text messages, for example. These transactions traditionally are referred to as economic or financial transactions, recorded and secured so that an enterprise can access the information anytime for accounting or reporting purposes.
As IT struggles to keep pace with the speed of business, it is important that when you choose an operational database you consider your immediate data needs and long-term data requirements.
For storing transactions, maintaining systems of record, or content management, you will need a database with high concurrency, high throughput, low latency, and mission-critical characteristics such as high availability, data protection, and disaster recovery.
Also, if your data needs grow and you want to expand the functionality of your application, adding more single-purpose or fit-for-purpose databases will only create data silos and amplify the data management problems.
Select a future-proof cloud database service with self-service capabilities that will automate all the data management so that your data consumers—developers, analysts, data engineers, data scientists and DBAs—can do more with the data and accelerate application development.
They had to evolve to handle the modern-day transactions, heterogeneous data, and global scale, and most importantly to run mixed workloads. Relational databases transformed into multimodal databases that store and process not only relational data but also all other types of data, including xml, html, JSON, Apache Avro and Parquet, and documents in their native form, without much transformation.
The choice depends heavily on your use case — transactional processing, analytical processing, in-memory database, and so on — but it also depends on other factors. This post covers the different database options available within Google Cloud across relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases and explains which use cases are best suited for each database option.
Provides managed MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQL Server databases on Google Cloud. It reduces maintenance cost and automates database provisioning, storage capacity management, back ups, and out-of-the-box high availability and disaster recovery/failover.
Non-relational databases are often used when large quantities of complex and diverse data need to be organized, or where the structure of the data is regularly evolving to meet new business requirements. Unlike relational databases, they perform faster because a query doesn’t have to access several tables to deliver an answer, making them ideal for storing data that may change frequently or for applications that handle many different kinds of data.
Indeed, at times too much information might overwhelm the user, threatening to saturate their workload capacity, a cognitive mechanism of limited size that distributes some resources, such as working memory, to cognitive processes as required.
Minimising the amount of cognitive resources spent on this cycle has the potential to decrease the imposition of the UI on the user’s workload capacity.
Workload capacity is the construct we have used to refer to the cognitive mechanism underpinning multitasking.
However, benchmarking and comparing the energy efficiency of GPGPU workloads is challenging as standardized workloads are rare and standardized power and efficiency measurement methods and metrics do not exist. In addition, not all GPGPU systems run at maximum load all the time. Systems that are utilized in transactional, request driven workloads, for example, can run at lower utilization levels. Existing benchmarks for GPGPU systems primarily consider performance and are intended only to run at maximum load.
Cloud computing is popular in industry due to its ability to deliver on-demand resources according to a pay-as-you-go model.
Generally, the providers implement an automatic provisioning approach via the virtualization technique. Virtualization makes it possible to rapidly scale the resources up or down. The aforementioned approaches present a reactive method, which is triggered by a certain threshold, such as CPU utilization or memory utilization. Actually, two or more thresholds should be used as a performance metric.
First we propose the elastic resource provisioning (ERP) approach on the performance threshold.
Thus, combining this with an automatic method and a proactive method would be more agile for provisioning the resources. For example, the Elastic VM architecture provisions the resources dynamically to reduce the SLA violation. However, the elasticity is necessary to meet the users’ demand from different perspectives.
It presents a cost-efficient method to scale up from the perspective of the providers. In contrast, our approach considers more factors to formulate the threshold by the cloud layer model, such as CPU utilization, memory utilization, etc. Additionally, we aim to scale the resources by minimizing the renting cost and response time.
CloudScale is a system that automates the fine-grained resources in cloud computing infrastructures, determining the adaptive resources by the prediction.
It implements an elastic resource provisioning approach in the datacenter. This algorithm takes the performance threshold as the baseline to scale the resources up or down.
Scalability means to the ability of the system to deal with an increasing amount of the servers in a capable manner.
In the automatic policy, the resources would be provisioned and released automatically according to the demand. Generally, the action is triggered by the fixed thresholds, such as the utilization. The common techniques are provided by Amazon and Scalr. However, they provision the resources only based on the utilization, when in fact more elements have taken effect.
PRESS is a predictive elasticity system that analyzes and extracts the workload patterns and provisions the resources automatically.
The auto-scaling mechanisms should allow the system to dynamically adapt to workload changes, by autonomously provisioning and de-provisioning resources (i.e., back-end servers), so that at each point in time, the available resources match the current service demand as closely as possible.
Deciding where to handle services and tasks, as well as provisioning an adequate amount of computing resources for this handling, is a main challenge of edge computing systems.
We propose the concept of spare edge device to handle dynamic load changes in an elastic way, as well as algorithms for provisioning these devices with different QoS/cost tradeoffs.
Similar scalability is observed in the sequential read and write workloads. Note that the Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) was set as 9000 to the Virtual SAN network interfaces to get maximum performance for the two disk group configuration for the All Read workload. This is mainly to reduce the CPU utilization consumed by the vSphere network stack at such high loads.
Setting a higher MTU (for example, 9000) may help to get maximum performance for all cached read workloads when using more than one disk group.
The second impact of removing the read cache is that workload performance should stay steady as the working set size is increased beyond the size of the “caching” tier SSD.
This workload can be used to understand the maximum random read I/Os per second (IOPS) that a storage solution can deliver.
In the All Read and Mixed R/W experiments, there are two important metrics to follow: I/Os per second (IOPS) and the mean latency encountered by each I/O operation.
The number of outstanding I/Os is 128 per VM for the All Read workload, and 32 per VM for the Mixed R/W workload.
The ECM Workload was executed regularly throughout the population, scaling to over 120,000 transactions per minute.
The Performance Efficiency pillar includes the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
Cloud storage is typically more reliable, scalable, and secure than traditional on-premises storage systems.
S3 Object Tags are key-value pairs applied to S3 objects which can be created, updated or deleted at any time during the lifetime of the object. With these, you have the ability to create Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, set up S3 Lifecycle policies, and customize storage metrics.

Amazon S3 provides management features so that you can optimize, organize, and configure access to your data to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.
DB instances for Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes for database and log storage.
In some cases, your database workload might not be able to achieve 100 percent of the IOPS that you have provisioned.
You can create MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and PostgreSQL RDS DB instances with up to 64 tebibytes (TiB) of storage.
Provisioned IOPS storage is designed to meet the needs of I/O-intensive workloads, particularly database workloads, that require low I/O latency and consistent I/O throughput. Provisioned IOPS storage is best suited for production environments.
For every DB engine except RDS for SQL Server, you can provision additional IOPS and storage throughput when storage size is at or above the threshold value. For RDS for SQL Server, you can provision additional IOPS and storage throughput for any available storage size. For all DB engines, you pay for only the additional provisioned storage performance.
If your workload is unpredictable, you can enable storage autoscaling for an Amazon RDS DB instance. To do so, you can use the Amazon RDS console, the Amazon RDS API, or the AWS CLI.
Scaling up database capacity can be a tedious and risky business. Even veteran developers and database administrators who understand the nuanced behavior of their database and application perform this work cautiously. Despite the current era of sharded NoSQL clusters, increasing capacity can take hours, days, or weeks.
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed database that developers and database administrators have relied on for more than 10 years.
It delivers low-latency performance at any scale and greatly simplifies database capacity management.
In June 2017, DynamoDB released auto scaling to make it easier for you to manage capacity efficiently, and auto scaling continues to help DynamoDB users lower the cost of workloads that have a predictable traffic pattern.
Before auto scaling, you would statically provision capacity in order to meet a table’s peak load plus a small buffer. In most cases, however, it isn’t cost-effective to statically provision a table above peak capacity.
It helps you identify and set up key metrics and logs across your application resources and technology stack, such as database, web (IIS) and application servers, operating system, load balancers, and queues.
Set up, operate, and scale a managed relational database in the cloud. Although you can set up a database on an EC2 instance, Amazon RDS offers the advantage of handling your database management tasks, such as patching the software, backing up, and storing the backups.
HBase is an open-source, non-relational, distributed database modeled after Google's Bigtable. It was developed as part of Apache Software Foundation's Hadoop project and runs on top of Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) to provide BigTable-like capabilities for Hadoop.
Amazon EBS provides two volume types: standard volumes and Provisioned IOPS volumes. They differ in performance characteristics and pricing model, allowing you to tailor your storage performance and cost to the needs of your applications. You can attach and stripe across multiple volumes of either type to increase the I/O performance available to your Amazon EC2 applications.
The first cloud data lake for enterprises that is secure, massively scalable and built to the open HDFS standard. With no limits to the size of data and the ability to run massively parallel analytics, you can now unlock value from all your unstructured, semi-structured and structured data.
Apache CouchDB (link resides outside ibm.com) is an open source NoSQL document database that collects and stores data in JSON-based document formats. Unlike relational databases, CouchDB uses a schema-free data model, which simplifies record management across various computing devices, mobile phones, and web browsers.
CouchDB is very customizable and opens the door to developing predictable and performance-driven applications regardless of your data volume or number of users.
If you don’t want to allocate a fixed number of EBS volumes at cluster creation time, use autoscaling local storage.
If a worker begins to run too low on disk, Databricks automatically attaches a new EBS volume to the worker before it runs out of disk space.
EBS volumes are attached up to a limit of 5 TB of total disk space per instance (including the instance’s local storage).
Your workloads may run more slowly because of the performance impact of reading and writing encrypted data to and from local volumes.
A 30 GB encrypted EBS instance root volume used by the host operating system and Databricks internal services.
Hadoop MapReduce is described as "a software framework for easily writing applications which process vast amounts of data (multi-terabyte data sets) in parallel on large clusters (thousands of nodes) of commodity hardware in a reliable, fault-tolerant manner."
MapReduce filters and sorts data while converting it into key-value pairs.
By using Spark's distributed computation engine, the package allows users to run large scale data analysis such as selection, filtering, aggregation from R. Karau et al. (2015) provides a summary of the state-of-the-art on using Spark.
When the amount of data in a company reaches a particularly large volume, increases rapidly and includes diverse data formats, this is referred to as a big data scenario.
When the data volume achieves a magnitude of about 100 TB, specialized and optimized relational database systems reach their architectural and technical limits. As the volume of data increases, so does the effort required to keep the data operationally available and consistent. Relational databases of this size are customized and require cost-intensive hardware.
Storage volumes remain available during this scaling-up operation.
How can companies support 10-1000x increases in query and transaction volumes, leverage 50x as much data for decision making, and do everything that used to take hours or days in seconds or fractions of a second?
Its performance for high volume, low latency transactions and data ingestion exceeds the read and write performance and scalability of traditional databases. Ignite can sit on top of all these databases at the same time as an IMDG and coordinate transactions in-memory with the underlying databases to ensure data is never lost.
PayPal, an eBay company, has used Hadoop and other software tools to detect fraud, but the colossal volumes of data were so large their systems were unable to perform the analysis quickly enough.
One estimate is that 80% of all data today is unstructured; unstructured data is growing 15 times faster than structured data4 and the total volume of data is expected to grow to 40 zettabytes (10^21 bytes) by 2020.
And the number of data engineers sought by companies has recently seen a 96% year-over-year change. But hiring alone is not enough to manage the increase in data volume.
Based on continuous observation of resource utilization trends, data-volume processing projections are offered to help with capacity planning. CLAIRE takes this to the next step by offering auto-scaling of data management runtime resources.
However, high volumes of low cost data on low cost hardware should not be misinterpreted as a signal for reduced service level agreement (SLA) expectations.
One of the features of Data ONTAP that NetApp users consistently comment on is the ability to nondisruptively grow and shrink data volumes as needs change. For example, you can provision a data volume for use with either NAS or SAN protocols and grow it over time to meet changing needs.
A higher priority gives a volume a greater percentage of available resources when a system is fully loaded.
Analogous to the clustering of multiple database servers in Oracle® Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC), storage resources across multiple storage controllers can be employed to deliver much greater I/O performance to an application than a single storage controller could achieve alone.
For example, Leuven University Hospital (UZ Leuven) consolidated all its critical Sybase database storage along with storage used by less critical SQL Server applications on a single set of NetApp storage systems.
Big Data requires processing high volumes of low-density data, that is, data of unknown value, such as twitter data feeds, clicks on a web page, network traffic, sensor-enabled equipment capturing data at the speed of light, and many more. It is the task of Big Data to convert low-density data into high-density data, that is, data that has value. For some companies, this might be tens of terabytes, for others it may be hundreds of petabytes.
By leveraging Oracle Exadata for your data warehouse, processing can be enhanced with flash memory, columnar databases, in-memory databases, and more.
Oracle NoSQL Database is designed as a highly scalable, distributed database based on Oracle Berkeley DB. Sleepycat Software. Oracle NoSQL Database is a general purpose, enterprise class key value store that adds an intelligent driver on top of an enhanced distributed Berkeley database.
Spark or MapReduce processing of high volume, high variety data from multiple data sources and then reduce and optimize dataset to calculate risk profiles.
Its performance for high volume, low latency transactions and data ingestion exceeds the read and write performance and scalability of traditional databases.
An Ignite cluster can also be used as a distributed, transactional IMDB to support high volume, low latency transactions, and data ingestion, or for low-cost storage.
Kafka on your own, you need to provision servers, configure Apache Kafka manually, replace servers when they fail, orchestrate server patches and upgrades, architect the cluster for high availability, ensure data is durably stored and secured, set up monitoring and alarms, and carefully plan scaling events to support load changes.
It automates most of the common administrative tasks associated with provisioning, configuring, monitoring, backing up, and securing a data warehouse, making it easy and inexpensive to manage and maintain. This automation enables you to build petabyte-scale data warehouses in minutes instead of weeks or months.
When the volume of data to be analyzed is of the order of terabytes or petabytes (billions of tweets or posts), scalable storage and computing solutions must be used, but no clear solutions today exist for the analysis of Exascale datasets.
Moving to social media applications, nowadays the huge volume of user-generated data in social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, are very precious sources of data from which to extract insights concerning human dynamics and behaviors.
As Exascale systems are likely to be based on large distributed memory hardware, MPI is one of the most natural programming systems.
On the other side, we have shared-memory models where the major system is OpenMP that offers a simple parallel programming model although it does not provide mechanisms to explicitly map and control data distribution and includes non-scalable synchronization operations that are making very challenging its implementation on massively parallel systems.
General issues like energy consumption, multitasking, scheduling, reproducibility, and resiliency must be addressed together with other data-oriented issues like data distribution and mapping, data access, data communication and synchronization.
ata locality mechanisms/constructs, like near-data computing must be designed and evaluated on big data applications when subsets of data are stored in nearby processors and by avoiding that locality is imposed when data must be moved. Other challenges concern data affinity control data querying (NoSQL approach), global data distribution and sharing patterns.
In order to resolve the contradiction between requirements of high performance and limited memory resource, we propose a scalable Main-Memory database system ScaMMDB which distributes data and operations to several nodes and makes good use of every node’s resource.
The system must be able to scale with the growth in data size and query volume. For example, it must support trillions of rows and petabytes of data. The update and query performance must hold even as these parameters grow significantly.
Mesa is Google's solution to these technical and operational challenges. Even though subsets of these requirements are solved by existing data warehousing systems, Mesa is unique in solving all of these problems simultaneously for business critical data. Mesa is a distributed, replicated, and highly available data processing, storage, and query system for structured data. Mesa ingests data generated by upstream services, aggregates and persists the data internally, and serves the data via user queries. Even though this paper mostly discusses Mesa in the context of ads metrics, Mesa is a generic data warehousing solution that satisfies all of the above requirements.
Napa: Powering Scalable Data Warehousing with Robust Query Performance at Google.
We need to store and serve these planet-scale data sets under extremely demanding requirements of scalability, sub-second query response times, availability even in the case of entire data center failures, strong consistency guarantees, ingesting a massive stream of updates coming from the applications used around the globe. We have developed and deployed in production an analytical data management system, called Napa, to meet these requirements.
At its core, Napa’s principal technologies for robust query performance include the aggressive use of materialized views that are maintained consistently as new data is ingested across multiple data centers. Our clients also demand flexibility in being able to adjust their query performance, data freshness, and costs to suit their unique needs. Robust query processing and flexible configuration of client databases are the hallmark of Napa design.
Charged with serving as the Federal lifeline for millions of citizens who need immediate help in the face of life-threatening disasters, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is working with Google Cloud services to run its data management system more efficiently, securely, and collaboratively.
Data unification allows for a single source of information in one repository, creating a shared ecosystem of large amounts of data that users can leverage in real time.
The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) STRIDES program and NCI Imaging Data Commons are using Google Cloud to help accelerate research productivity with purpose built, scalable data management tools.
Photon is deployed within Google Advertising System to join data streams such as web search queries and user clicks on advertisements. It produces joined logs that are used to derive key business metrics, including billing for advertisers. Our production deployment processes millions of events per minute at peak with an average end-to-end latency of less than 10 seconds.
Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer “siloed.” Sometimes, these two teams are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function.
In some DevOps models, quality assurance and security teams may also become more tightly integrated with development and operations and throughout the application lifecycle. When security is the focus of everyone on a DevOps team, this is sometimes referred to as DevSecOps.
These teams use practices to automate processes that historically have been manual and slow. They use a technology stack and tooling which help them operate and evolve applications quickly and reliably. These tools also help engineers independently accomplish tasks (for example, deploying code or provisioning infrastructure) that normally would have required help from other teams, and this further increases a team’s velocity.
The DevOps model enables your developers and operations teams to achieve these results. For example, microservices and continuous delivery let teams take ownership of services and then release updates to them quicker.
Increase the frequency and pace of releases so you can innovate and improve your product faster. The quicker you can release new features and fix bugs, the faster you can respond to your customers’ needs and build competitive advantage. Continuous integration and continuous delivery are practices that automate the software release process, from build to deploy.
Ensure the quality of application updates and infrastructure changes so you can reliably deliver at a more rapid pace while maintaining a positive experience for end users. Use practices like continuous integration and continuous delivery to test that each change is functional and safe. Monitoring and logging practices help you stay informed of performance in real-time.
Operate and manage your infrastructure and development processes at scale. Automation and consistency help you manage complex or changing systems efficiently and with reduced risk. For example, infrastructure as code helps you manage your development, testing, and production environments in a repeatable and more efficient manner.
Continuous integration is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. The key goals of continuous integration are to find and address bugs quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.
Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. It expands upon continuous integration by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and/or a production environment after the build stage. When continuous delivery is implemented properly, developers will always have a deployment-ready build artifact that has passed through a standardized test process.
Infrastructure as code is a practice in which infrastructure is provisioned and managed using code and software development techniques, such as version control and continuous integration. The cloud’s API-driven model enables developers and system administrators to interact with infrastructure programmatically, and at scale, instead of needing to manually set up and configure resources. Thus, engineers can interface with infrastructure using code-based tools and treat infrastructure in a manner similar to how they treat application code. Because they are defined by code, infrastructure and servers can quickly be deployed using standardized patterns, updated with the latest patches and versions, or duplicated in repeatable ways.
You're familiar with creating and managing IAM users, roles, and policies. You want to ensure that your development engineers and quality assurance team members can access the resources they need. You also need a strategy that scales as your company grows.
AWS's policy regarding the use of security assessment tools and services allows significant flexibility for performing security assessments of your AWS assets while protecting other AWS customers and ensuring quality-of-service across AWS.
The term "security assessment" refers to all activity engaged in for the purposes of determining the efficacy or existence of security controls amongst your AWS assets, e.g., port-scanning, vulnerability scanning/checks, penetration testing, exploitation, web application scanning, as well as any injection, forgery, or fuzzing activity, either performed remotely against your AWS assets, amongst/between your AWS assets, or locally within the virtualized assets themselves.
Customers wishing to perform a DDoS simulation test should review our DDoS Simulation Testing policy.
Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor monitors the quality of Amazon SageMaker machine learning models in production.
With Model Monitor, you can set alerts that notify you when there are deviations in the model quality.
Early and proactive detection of these deviations enables you to take corrective actions, such as retraining models, auditing upstream systems, or fixing quality issues without having to monitor models manually or build additional tooling.
Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor automatically monitors machine learning (ML) models in production and notifies you when quality issues arise.
In this blog post, we introduce Deequ, an open source tool developed and used at Amazon. Deequ allows you to calculate data quality metrics on your dataset, define and verify data quality constraints, and be informed about changes in the data distribution.
Deequ is implemented on top of Apache Spark and is designed to scale with large datasets (think billions of rows) that typically live in a distributed filesystem or a data warehouse.
Deequ computes data quality metrics, that is, statistics such as completeness, maximum, or correlation. Deequ uses Spark to read from sources such as Amazon S3, and to compute metrics through an optimized set of aggregation queries.
In addition to the software, hardware, human resource and real estate assets that are encompassed in the scope of the AWS quality management system supporting the development and operations of AWS services, it also includes documented information including, but not limited to source code, system documentation and operational policies and procedures.
AWS implements formal, documented policies and procedures that provide guidance for operations and information security within the organization and the supporting AWS environments. Policies address purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities and management commitment. All policies are maintained in a centralized location that is accessible by employees.
The AWS quality system is documented to ensure that planning is consistent with all other requirements.
AWS continuously monitors service usage to project infrastructure needs to support availability commitments and requirements. AWS maintains a capacity planning model to assess infrastructure usage and demands at least monthly, and usually more frequently. In addition, the AWS capacity planning model supports the planning of future demands to acquire and implement additional resources based upon current resources and forecasted requirements.
AWS offers commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) IT services according to IT quality and security standards such as ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, ISO 9001, NIST 800-53 and many others.
It's important to run controlled tests and monitor the same environment or workstation as those reporting the issue, and be able to reproduce the same use cases. Consider the following general testing recommendations for measuring and gathering data to investigate voice quality issues.
To ensure the ultimate level of security, you need to integrate health checks into your workflow, and DevOps is the best method of achieving this goal. Amazon Inspector is one of the AWS tools for testers that is delivered as a service that facilitates an easier adoption into the existing DevOps process. DevSecOps extends DevOps with QA and entails continuous communication among operational teams, developers, and testers.
Amazon CodeGuru Security is a static application security testing (SAST) tool that combines machine learning (ML) and automated reasoning to identify vulnerabilities in your code, provide recommendations on how to fix the identified vulnerabilities, and track the status of the vulnerabilities until closure.
To begin reviewing code, you can associate your existing code repositories on GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, Bitbucket, or AWS CodeCommit in the CodeGuru console.
We have about 300+ microservices right now that are being reviewed and managed by CodeGuru Reviewer.
Amazon CodeGuru has helped expedite our software development lifecycle by streamlining the code review process. As the primary code reviewer on the team, I can now focus more on the functionality and feature implementation of the code as opposed to searching for security vulnerabilities and best practices that may not have been followed.
At Atlassian, many of our services have hundreds of check-ins per deployment. While code reviews from our development team do a great job of preventing bugs from reaching production, it’s not always possible to predict how systems will behave under stress or manage complex data shapes, especially as we have multiple deployments per day.
Integrate CodeGuru into your existing software development workflow to automate code reviews during application development and continuously monitor application's performance in production and provide recommendations and visual clues on how to improve code quality, application performance, and reduce overall cost.
The software development starts with design documents and reviews, and moves through code reviews. A security review will be conducted by both the independent AWS Security team as well as the Amazon EC2 engineering team for significant changes or features.
Once code reviews and approvals are complete, and all automated checks are passed, our automated package deployment process takes over. As part of this automated deployment pipeline, binary artifacts are built and teams run end-to-end, validation, and security-specific tests. If any type of validation fails, the deployment process is halted until the issue is remediated.
AWS provides the AWS Well-Architected Tool to help you review your approach prior to development, the state of your workloads prior to production, and the state of your workloads in production. You can compare workloads to the latest AWS architectural best practices, monitor their overall status, and gain insight into potential risks.
If a package is not included as part of a validated system, then by implication it is not approved for use within the controlled environment. If the environment permits a user to install their own packages the onus would be on the user to take extra precautions to ensure that it behaves as expected for their specific use case. In all cases, it is expected that users would follow their internal Quality Assurance Standard Operating Procedures.
Our dedicated security team includes some of the world's foremost experts in information security, application security, cryptography, and network security. This team maintains our defense systems, develops security review processes, builds security infrastructure, and implements our security policies. The team actively scans for security threats using commercial and custom tools. The team also conducts penetration tests and performs quality assurance and security reviews.
At a high level, cloud-native architecture means adapting to the many new possibilities—but very different set of architectural constraints—offered by the cloud compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure.
While the functional aspects don't change too much, the cloud offers, and sometimes requires, very different ways to meet non-functional requirements, and imposes very different architectural constraints. If architects fail to adapt their approach to these different constraints, the systems they architect are often fragile, expensive, and hard to maintain. A well-architected cloud native system, on the other hand, should be largely self-healing, cost efficient, and easily updated and maintained through Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD).
Automation has always been a best practice for software systems, but cloud makes it easier than ever to automate the infrastructure as well as components that sit above it.
Automated processes can repair, scale, deploy your system far faster than people can.
Infrastructure: Automate the creation of the infrastructure, together with updates to it, using tools like Google Cloud Deployment Manager or Terraform
Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery: Automate the build, testing, and deployment of the packages that make up the system by using tools like Google Cloud Build, Jenkins and Spinnaker. Not only should you automate the deployment, you should strive to automate processes like canary testing and rollback.
Scale up and scale down: Unless your system load almost never changes, you should automate the scale up of the system in response to increases in load, and scale down in response to sustained drops in load. By scaling up, you ensure your service remains available, and by scaling down you reduce costs.
Monitoring and automated recovery: You should bake monitoring and logging into your cloud-native systems from inception. Logging and monitoring data streams can naturally be used for monitoring the health of the system, but can have many uses beyond this.
This means that almost all of the principles of good architectural design still apply for cloud-native architecture.
The largest design constraint for the implementation of the project is financial.
The development and integration of the new software components into the existing open source software application is a major constraint.
Resources can be provisioned as temporary, disposable units, freeing users from the inflexibility and constraints of a fixed and finite IT infrastructure.
Reducing power consumption will require adding architectural improvements to process and circuit improvements. Thus, elevating power to a first-class constraint must be a priority early in the design stage when architectural tradeoffs are made as designers perform cycle-accurate simulation.
Multi-objective optimizations were performed based on actual design constraints.
Optimal solutions identified for differing design constraints in a short time.
To investigate this question, we first present and formalize the design constraints for building an autonomous driving system in terms of performance, predictability, storage, thermal and power.
With accelerator-based designs, we are able to build an end-to-end autonomous driving system that meets all the design constraints, and explore the trade-offs among performance, power and the higher accuracy enabled by higher resolution cameras.
Among all the practices that SLSA and NIST SSDF promote, using application-level security scanning as part of continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) systems for production releases was the most common practice, with 63% of respondents saying this was “very” or “completely” established. Preserving code history and using build scripts are also highly established, while signing metadata and requiring a two-person review process have the most room for growth.
To that end, the data indicate that organizational culture and modern development processes (such as continuous integration) are the biggest drivers of an organization’s software security and are the best place to start for organizations looking to improve their security posture.
CI plays an increasingly important role in DevOps, allowing enterprises to drive quality from the start of their development cycle.
Today, we are honored to share that Cloud Build, Google Cloud’s continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) platform, was named a Leader in The Forrester Wave™: Cloud-Native Continuous Integration Tools, Q3 2019. The report identifies the 10 CI providers that matter most for continuous integration (CI) and how they stack up on 27 criterias.
OSS-Fuzz offers CIFuzz, a GitHub action/CI job that runs your fuzz targets on pull requests. This works similarly to running unit tests in CI. CIFuzz helps you find and fix bugs before they make it into your codebase. Currently, CIFuzz primarily supports projects hosted on GitHub. Non-OSS-Fuzz users can use CIFuzz with additional features through ClusterFuzzLite.
Lighthouse CI is a suite of tools for using Lighthouse during continuous integration. Lighthouse CI can be incorporated into developer workflows in many different ways.
Lighthouse CI shows how these findings have changed over time. This can be used to identify the impact of particular code changes or ensure that performance thresholds are met during continuous integration processes. Although performance monitoring is the most common use case for Lighthouse CI, it can be used to monitor other aspects of the Lighthouse report - for example, SEO or accessibility.
Continuous Integration (CI) is emerging as one of the biggest success stories in automated software engineering. CI systems automate the compilation, building, testing and deployment of software.
DevOps is a popular practice in developing and operating large-scale software systems. This practice provides benefits such as shortening the development cycles, increasing deployment velocity, and dependable releases. To achieve these benefits, you introduce two concepts in the software system development: Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD)
Testing an ML system is more involved than testing other software systems. In addition to typical unit and integration tests, you need data validation, trained model quality evaluation, and model validation.
In this level, your system continuously delivers new pipeline implementations to the target environment that in turn delivers prediction services of the newly trained model. For rapid and reliable continuous delivery of pipelines and models, you should consider the following:
Rather, it means deploying an ML pipeline that can automate the retraining and deployment of new models. Setting up a CI/CD system enables you to automatically test and deploy new pipeline implementations. This system lets you cope with rapid changes in your data and business environment.
You can gradually implement these practices to help improve the automation of your ML system development and production.
The steps of the ML experiment are orchestrated. The transition between steps is automated, which leads to rapid iteration of experiments and better readiness to move the whole pipeline to production.
CT of the model in production: The model is automatically trained in production using fresh data based on live pipeline triggers, which are discussed in the next section.
Continuous delivery of models: An ML pipeline in production continuously delivers prediction services to new models that are trained on new data. The model deployment step, which serves the trained and validated model as a prediction service for online predictions, is automated.
Therefore, automated data validation and model validation steps are required in the production pipeline to ensure the following expected behavior:
An optional additional component for level 1 ML pipeline automation is a feature store.
Network automation substantially increases network efficiency to lower the cost per bit and maximize profit.
While hyper-scale cloud operators drove much of the new technologies and systems that they used to build their infrastructure, most enterprises do not have the time, skillset, or resources to build out their own homegrown cloud automation platform.
Modern network architectures require a system approach with real-time automation, using open state-streaming APIs for continuous real-time synchronization of network state and configuration, and providing advanced AI/ML analytics to provide instantaneous compliance, visibility, and troubleshooting.
DevOps CI/CD Model. This model is typically deployed by relatively large service providers or enterprises, as they embark on an automation journey. Their approach includes using automation frameworks – typically also being used by the DevOps compute and platform operations teams – such as Hashicorp Terraform or Red Hat Ansible to automate the provisioning of the network infrastructure and to drive down OpEx costs. These customers have the resources and skills to write their own custom scripts and are invested in DevOps automation approaches with committed resources. Arista supports these customers by providing open software integration into DevOps frameworks like Terraform, Ansible, Puppet, and Chef, as well as supporting streaming receiver platforms like ELK stack, Prometheus, and others.
CloudVision is a modern, multi-domain network management platform built on cloud networking principles for telemetry, analytics, and automation.
For Arista customers, CloudVision can be customized using the APIs to integrate with customer-developed scripts and programs using python, go, or other languages, and with DevOps workflows using the available Arista-provided CloudVision extensions for open-source automation tools like Ansible and Terraform.
Agile supports Agile planning methods (learn more about Agile methodologies at the Agile Alliance), including Scrum, and tracks development and test activities separately. This process works great if you want to track user stories and (optionally) bugs on the Kanban board, or track bugs and tasks on the Taskboard.
Scrum tracks work using product backlog items (PBIs) and bugs on the Kanban board or viewed on a sprint Taskboard.
Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) supports a framework for process improvement and an auditable record of decisions. With this process, you can track requirements, change requests, risks, and reviews. This process supports formal change management activities.
Consider managing your bug bar and technical debt as part of your team's overall set of continuous improvement activities. You may find these resources of interest:
While bugs contribute to technical debt, they may not represent all debt.
Poor software design, poorly written code, or short-term fixes can all contribute to technical debt. Technical debt reflects extra development work that arises from all these problems.
Track work to address technical debt as PBIs, user stories, or bugs. To track a team's progress in incurring and addressing technical debt, you'll want to consider how to categorize the work item and the details you want to track.
Scrum Masters help build and maintain healthy teams by employing Scrum processes. They guide, coach, teach, and assist Scrum teams in the proper employment of Scrum methods. Scrum Masters also act as change agents to help teams overcome impediments and to drive the team toward significant productivity increases.
Daily Scrum meetings help keep a team focused on what it needs to do the next day. Staying focused helps the team maximize their ability to meet sprint commitments. Your Scrum Master should enforce the structure of the meeting and ensure that it starts on time and finishes in 15 minutes or less.
Good Scrum Masters have or develop excellent communication, negotiation, and conflict resolution skills.
The product owner is responsible for what the team builds, and why they build it. The product owner is responsible for keeping the backlog of work up to date and in priority order
The Scrum master ensures that the Scrum process is followed by the team. Scrum masters are continually on the lookout for how the team can improve, while also resolving impediments and other blocking issues that arise during the sprint. Scrum masters are part coach, part team member, and part cheerleader.
The members of the Scrum team actually build the product. The team owns the engineering of the product, and the quality that goes with it.
The product backlog is a prioritized list of work the team can deliver. The product owner is responsible for adding, changing, and reprioritizing the backlog as needed. The items at the top of the backlog should always be ready for the team to execute on.
In sprint planning, the team chooses backlog items to work on in the upcoming sprint. The team chooses backlog items based on priority and what they believe they can complete in the sprint. The sprint backlog is the list of items the team plans to deliver in the sprint. Often, each item on the sprint backlog is broken down into tasks. Once all members agree the sprint backlog is achievable, the sprint starts.
The team takes time to reflect on what went well and which areas need improvement. The outcome of the retrospective are actions for the next sprint.
The entire cycle is repeated for the next sprint. Sprint planning selects the next items on the product backlog and the cycle repeats. While the team executes the sprint, the product owner ensures the items at the top of the backlog are ready to execute in the following sprint.
Alleviate technical debt with IT modernization that works.
Even so, organizations have invested money, time, and training in their existing infrastructure and need to maximize its value and return. This technical debt often leaves little budget and time for innovation.
Modernizing your applications and other elements of your IT environment can help reduce technical debt in your current infrastructure and free time and budget for strategic projects that support business initiatives.
Technical debt refers to the side effects of prioritising time, money, and workarounds over quality in the delivery of enterprise IT.
Plan an integrated organisation-wide approach to remediation; review and update often. Consider the aspects of technical debt that you may be introducing with every new “go live” .
IDC predicts that through 2023, coping with technical debt accumulated during the pandemic will challenge 50% of CIOs. This technical debt is a result of what were imperative but necessarily fast-tracked implementations of solutions for new, remote working arrangements after the onset of COVID-19.
Investing in right sizing enterprise cloud environments and integrating these with older stop-gap solutions will help minimise the burden of technical debt.
Technical debt is a metaphor that is defined as the result of an IT departments preference to taking shortcuts using basic techniques comma not considering long-term consequences when developing and implementing code comma and delaying the upgrade of infrastructure on a timely basis.
Utilizing Legacy software development platforms that require a high number of lines of code versus rapid application development platforms Legacy platforms generate technical debt due to their coding complexity in the Labor standardization while rapid application development platforms bracket such as a low code or no code bracket provide a visual development approach which can save up to 40 to 50% of coding effort.
Generally, when you’re tracking and prioritising technical debt work, engineering mostly focuses on non-optimal code — or short-term implementation shortcuts — used to deliver a project faster.
User satisfaction, value delivered and product marketability are as dependent on UI/UX as performance, and that’s where functional debt poses a threat. And similarly to technical debt, functional debt is hard to identify and pay down.
Technical debt is about how a feature was implemented.
Rich text editors are inherently complex, with busy feature roadmaps, which creates an environment where both technical and functional debt rapidly accrue.
Engineers tend to notice technical debt. Designers more likely notice functional debt.
As manual processes are digitized and automated, operational overheads and protocols only increase complexity and technical debt, resulting in applications and networks that incur hidden costs and unexpected externalities.
SDLC or the Software Development Life Cycle is a process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time possible. SDLC provides a well-structured flow of phases that help an organization to quickly produce high-quality software which is well-tested and ready for production use.
It’s also important to know that there is a strong focus on the testing phase. As the SDLC is a repetitive methodology, you have to ensure code quality at every cycle. Many organizations tend to spend few efforts on testing while a stronger focus on testing can save them a lot of rework, time, and money. Be smart and write the right types of tests.
The Agile SDLC model separates the product into cycles and delivers a working product very quickly. This methodology produces a succession of releases. Testing of each release feeds back info that’s incorporated into the next version.
The application development life cycle management (ADLM) tool market focuses on the planning and governance activities of the software development life cycle (SDLC). ADLM products focus on the "development" portion of an application's life.
Get integrated testing and lifecycle traceability that provide visibility across artifacts for a complete view of development, to ensure the product meets all requirements and is fully tested.
The SDLC life cycle process is repeated, with each release adding more functionality until all requirements are met. In this method, every cycle act as the maintenance phase for the previous software release. Modification to the incremental model allows development cycles to overlap. After that subsequent cycle may begin before the previous cycle is complete.
The full form SDLC is Software Development Life Cycle or Systems Development Life Cycle.
The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software. The goal of SDLC is to minimize project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond. This methodology outlines a series of steps that divide the software development process into tasks you can assign, complete, and measure.
The software development lifecycle (SDLC) outlines several tasks required to build a software application. The development process goes through several stages as developers add new features and fix bugs in the software.
The agile model arranges the SDLC phases into several development cycles. The team iterates through the phases rapidly, delivering only small, incremental software changes in each cycle. They continuously evaluate requirements, plans, and results so that they can respond quickly to change. The agile model is both iterative and incremental, making it more efficient than other process models.
Rapid development cycles help teams identify and address issues in complex projects early on and before they become significant problems. They can also engage customers and stakeholders to obtain feedback throughout the project lifecycle.
In traditional software development, security testing was a separate process from the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
DevSecOps is the practice of integrating security testing at every stage of the software development process. It includes tools and processes that encourage collaboration between developers, security specialists, and operation teams to build software that can withstand modern threats. In addition, it ensures that security assurance activities such as code review, architecture analysis, and penetration testing are integral to development efforts.
The abbreviation SDLC can sometimes refer to the systems development lifecycle, the process for planning and creating an IT system.
Having achieved some understanding of the Project Management and System Development lifecycles, and having learned to discern relative value of their multitudinous deliverables, we are now well positioned to come up with a sequence of milestones that can communicate the status of the project in a fashion meaningful to the Project and Executive Sponsor layers of the organization.
The later a bug is found in the SDLC, the more expensive it becomes to fix. When a bug is found late in the cycle, developers must drop the work they are doing, and go back to revisit code they may have written weeks ago. Even worse, when a bug is found in production, the code gets sent all the way back to the beginning of the SDLC.
PowerApps canvas app coding standards and guidelines.
It contains standards for naming objects, collections, and variables, and guidelines for developing consistent, performant, and easily maintainable apps.
This white paper was developed as a collaboration between the Microsoft PowerApps team, Microsoft IT, and industry professionals. Of course, enterprise customers are free to develop their own standards and practices. However, we feel that adherence to these guidelines will help developers in these areas:
The standards and guidelines are targeted at the enterprise application maker (developer) who is responsible for designing, building, testing, deploying, and maintaining PowerApps apps in a small business, corporate, or government environment.
As we mention in the white paper, these coding standards and guidelines are flexible and serve as a starting point for organizations to develop their own standards. This white paper is intended to be a living document.
Coding standards are collections of coding rules, guidelines, and best practices. Using the right one — such as C coding standards and C++ coding standards — will help you write cleaner code.
The reason why coding standards are important is that they help to ensure safety, security, and reliability. Every development team should use one. Even the most experienced developer could introduce a coding defect — without realizing it. And that one defect could lead to a minor glitch.
Using C coding standards is a smart way to find undefined and unpredictable behaviors.
There are several established standards. Some are specifically designed for functional safety — such as MISRA. Others are focused on secure coding, including CERT.
Adoption and management of coding standards (e.g. MISRA) at large scale in complex codebases.
The standard is comprised of 12 parts that span the breadth of the automotive safety lifecycle including management, development, production, operation service, and decommissioning.
Static code analysis to identify coding standards and security vulnerabilities during development (Appendix E.3.3).
Synopsys is also involved as a member in formulating the SAE J3061 and ISO 21434 standards, which define comprehensive strategies for automotive cybersecurity.
Coverity allows the enforcement of commonly used language subsets and coding standards – e.g. MISRA C/C++, AUTOSAR C++, CERT C/C++, and others.
Custom coding rules can be authored for specific API or organizational coding standards as required using the Code XM extension framework.
While coding standards such as MISRA will restrict the available concurrency functions available for use, Coverity includes a number of built-in checks specifically targeted at finding concurrency related errors including deadlocks, resource exhaustion, and inconsistent usage of locking and thread management routines.
The standard supplies numerous guidelines for software design and implementation to ensure the correct order of execution, consistency of interfaces, correctness of data flow and control flow, simplicity, readability and comprehensibility, and robustness.
During development, Synopsys enables developers to ensure that their code conforms to ISO 26262 design principles. This is accomplished primarily by implementing industry-specific coding standards rules such as MISRA C/C++.
Now, three years post-implementation, AHIMA is defining a “new normal” by establishing ICD-10-CM/PCS coding productivity benchmarks. To do so, several building blocks have been created, to be followed by an AHIMA-led systemic, highly credible study resulting in the standard for coding productivity.
February 2016, coding productivity was at approximately 50 percent of the standard established in 2007, about 40 minutes (or 1.5 records per hour).
Such changes in the health environment will be taken into account as AHIMA proceeds toward an updated coding productivity standard.
Overall, AHIMA has provided multiple coding standard examples for ICD-10-CM/PCS for inpatient records.

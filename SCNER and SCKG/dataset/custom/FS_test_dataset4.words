Practices like CI/CD and automation have become the norm in every engineering organization.
Traditionally, many organizations have dedicated systems admins or Ops teams responsible for running IT operations.
A relatively new role popularized by Google, site reliability engineers are software engineers who design, code, and maintain an operations function.
In Companies of all sizes, including leading tech companies like Atlassian, Amazon, Google, and Netflix, expect all engineers to take on-call responsibilities to varying degrees. For example, while Amazon focuses on full ownership and expects developers to take on-call responsibilities, Google follows the principles of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and expects a healthy relationship between SRE teams and service teams (more on this later in the “Site reliability engineering approach to on call” section, below).
Google’s VP of Engineering and father of SRE, Ben Treynor, defines site reliability engineers as software engineers who design an operations function.
As agile teams matured and grew, they became challenged with how to:
Scrum team is a group of individuals responsible for defining, building, and testing components/features within their agile process.
System architect/engineer is responsible for alignment with enterprise and solution architecture, and identifying and creation of solution architecture to be delivered by teams architecture.
Product management is responsible for product backlog content and prioritization.
While containers offer great benefits for our developers and customers in terms of being able to deploy code that can be used in a variety of environments, they can be a source of security vulnerabilities if the contents of the images consist of out-of-date or otherwise insecure libraries or components.
The Atlassian Security Team creates alerts on our security analytics platform and monitors for indicators of compromise. Our SRE teams use this platform to monitor for availability or performance issues. Logs are retained for 30 days in hot backup, and 365 days in cold backup.
GoodData has appointed a dedicated information security organization led by the chief information security officer (CISO), who has the executive responsibility for information security across the corporation and leads the security and compliance department.
Data processing and cleanup can consume more than half of an analytics team’s time, including that of highly paid data scientists, which limits scalability and frustrates employees. Indeed, the productivity of employees across the organization can suffer: respondents to our 2019 Global Data Transformation Survey reported that an average of 30 percent of their total enterprise time was spent on non-value-added tasks because of poor data quality and availability (Exhibit 1).

Target tracking scaling — Increase and decrease the current capacity of the group based on a Amazon CloudWatch metric and a target value.
With target tracking, an Auto Scaling group scales in direct proportion to the actual load on your application. That means that in addition to meeting the immediate need for capacity in response to load changes, a target tracking policy can also adapt to load changes that take place over time, for example, due to seasonal variations.
An Auto Scaling group has a maximum capacity of 3, a current capacity of 2, and a dynamic scaling policy that adds 3 instances. When invoking this policy, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling adds only 1 instance to the group to prevent the group from exceeding its maximum size.
An Auto Scaling group has a minimum capacity of 2, a current capacity of 3, and a dynamic scaling policy that removes 2 instances. When invoking this policy, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling removes only 1 instance from the group to prevent the group from becoming less than its minimum size.
In this case, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can scale out above the maximum size limit, but only by up to your maximum instance weight. Its intention is to get as close to the new desired capacity as possible but still adhere to the allocation strategies that are specified for the group.

Load balancing is the process of redistribution of workload in a distributed system like cloud computing ensuring no computing machine is overloaded, under-loaded or idle [12, 13]. Load balancing tries to speed up different constrained parameters like response time, execution time, system stability etc. thereby improving performance of cloud [14, 15]. It is an optimization technique in which task scheduling is an NP hard problem. There are a large number of load balancing approaches proposed by researchers where most of focus has been concerned on task scheduling, task allocation, resource scheduling, resource allocation, and resource management.
Autoscale using a capacity metric as observed by the load balancer. This will automatically discount unhealthy instances from the average.
Load balancing, load shedding, and autoscaling are all systems designed for the same goal: to equalize and stabilize the system load.
Dressy’s development teams investigate and notice a problem: their load balancing is inexplicably drawing all user traffic into region A, even though that region is full-to-overflowing and both B and C are empty (and equally large).
Load balancing minimizes latency by routing to the location closest to the user. Autoscaling can work together with load balancing to increase the size of locations close to the user and then route more traffic there, creating a positive feedback loop.
Load balancer helps in allocation of resources to the tasks fairly for resource utilization and user satisfaction at minimum cost, which motivates us to find issues in load balancing and to work on resolving them.
You must also consider other functionalities that may be necessary for your specific workload—for example, ingestion requirements, push-down compute requirements, and size at limit.
Our previous research using test runs, execution time, and test input information for reliability analysis and improvement is extended to ensure better test workload measurements for reliability assessment and prediction.
To solve the mentioned issues, we propose the ERP approach to provision the resources by the performance threshold, including the CPU and the memory. According to the threshold, we would flexibly scale the resources up or down by considering multiple perspectives. From the perspective of the provider, the goal is aimed at minimizing the amount of the resources to reduce the energy consumption. From the perspective of the users, the goal is aimed at rapidly scaling the resources up or down.
Therefore, it is important to scale the resources from different granularities, including horizontal elasticity and vertical elasticity.
In fact, elasticity is essential to meet a fluctuating workload, and it is necessary to determine the suitable amount of the resources in order to scale the resources.
Automated resource provisioning techniques enable the implementation of elastic services, by adapting the available resources to the service demand. This is essential for reducing power consumption and guaranteeing QoS and SLA fulfillment, especially for those services with strict QoS requirements in terms of latency or response time, such as web servers with high traffic load, data stream processing, or real-time big data analytics. Elasticity is often implemented in cloud platforms and virtualized data-centers by means of auto-scaling mechanisms. These make automated resource provisioning decisions based on the value of specific infrastructure and/or service performance metrics.
On the other hand, service elasticity enables power consumption to be reduced, by avoiding resource over-provisioning.
Most control-based systems are reactive mechanisms, for example Lim et al. [30] propose extending the cloud platform with an external feedback controller that enable users to automate the resource provisioning, and introduce the concept of proportional thresholding, a new control policy that takes into account the coarse-grained actuators provided by resource providers.
In contrast to existing works, we propose a non-demand elastic resource provisioning to minimize the overall power consumption of the network (i.e., joint power consumption of the cell sites and VBS pool) while maximizing the resource utilization.
Amazon RDS provides three storage types: General Purpose SSD (also known as gp2 and gp3), Provisioned IOPS SSD (also known as io1), and magnetic (also known as standard). They differ in performance characteristics and price, which means that you can tailor your storage performance and cost to the needs of your database workload.
When you create a DynamoDB table, auto scaling is the default capacity setting, but you can also enable auto scaling on any table that does not have it active.
Amazon DynamoDB is a fast, fully-managed NoSQL database service that makes it simple and cost effective to store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. DynamoDB helps offload the administrative burden of operating and scaling a highly-available distributed database cluster. This storage alternative meets the latency and throughput requirements of highly demanding applications by providing single-digit millisecond latency and predictable performance with seamless throughput and storage scalability.
With autoscaling local storage, Databricks monitors the amount of free disk space available on your cluster’s Spark workers.
OpenSearch Service supports 1 EBS volume (max size of 1.5 TB) per instance associated with a domain. With the default maximum of 20 data nodes allowed per OpenSearch Service domain, you can allocate about 30 TB of EBS storage to a single domain.
If successful, they would like to expand this offering to their consumer line as well, with a much larger volume and a greater market share.
The expansion of IoT, connected devices and people is generating volumes of data that exceed the storage capacity of any traditional database system. This new type of data is often in formats that are not suitable for storing in relational database tables or for querying using relational query semantics.
But as the volume of data continues to grow exponentially, managing backup and recovery and meeting strict protection service-level objectives (SLOs) has become increasingly challenging.
The problem is, as data volumes grow, querying against a huge, centrally located data set becomes slow and inefficient, and performance suffers.
An increasing amount of data is generated and collected across machines, enterprises and applications in unstructured or non-relational format. These data types are characterized not just by the large volumes, but also by their velocity, variety and variability. “Data drifting” is a term that is now commonly used to depict the fluctuation in the format, the pace and the content of data in these new data types.
Particularly for SAN performance, some storage vendors say that imposing any type of data layout overhead on the data volume reduces performance.
Several teams of scientists run complex applications to analyze subsets of those huge volumes of data.
Indeed, processing very large data volumes requires operations and new algorithms able to scale in loading, storing, and processing massive amounts of data that generally must be partitioned in very small data grains, on which thousands to millions of simple parallel operations do analysis.
In-memory querying and analytics needed to reduce query response times and execution of analytics operations by caching large volumes of data in the computing node RAMs and issuing queries and other operation in parallel on the main memory of computing nodes.
NEON was designed for the grand challenges in ecology and Paula Mabee shared how they are partnering with Google to collect and manage over 400 terabytes of raw data per year across 182 data products to accelerate discoveries and help get these important data and knowledge to the into the hands of scientists and decision makers.
Developers and operations teams collaborate closely, share many responsibilities, and combine their workflows. This reduces inefficiencies and saves time (e.g. reduced handover periods between developers and operations, writing code that takes into account the environment in which it is run).
AWS customers are welcome to carry out security assessments or penetration tests of their AWS infrastructure without prior approval for the services listed in the next section under “Permitted Services.” Additionally, AWS permits customers to host their security assessment tooling within the AWS IP space or other cloud provider for on-prem, in AWS, or third party contracted testing. All security testing that includes Command and Control (C2) requires prior approval.
AWS’s strategy for design and development of AWS services is to clearly define services in terms of customer use cases, service performance, marketing and distribution requirements, production and testing, and legal and regulatory requirements.

In this post we set out five principles of cloud-native architecture that will help to ensure your designs take full advantage of the cloud while avoiding the pitfalls of shoe-horning old approaches into a new platform.
The solution architect must understand all these constraints, compare them, and then make a number of technological and managerial decisions to reconcile these restrictions with project goals.
Speed, Scale, And Security Are The Important Differentiators As organizations transition to continuous delivery (CD) and shift hosting of production workloads to cloud servers, traditional, on-premises continuous integration will no longer suffice. Cloud-native CI products with exceptional build speed, on-demand scale, and secure configurations will lead the market and enable customers to accelerate delivery speed and lower management costs, all while meeting corporate compliance needs.
Continuous integration (CI) systems automate the compilation, building, and testing of software. Despite CI rising as a big success story in automated software engineering, it has received almost no attention from the research community.
This document discusses techniques for implementing and automating continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), and continuous training (CT) for machine learning (ML) systems.
This document is for data scientists and ML engineers who want to apply DevOps principles to ML systems (MLOps). MLOps is an ML engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying ML system development (Dev) and ML system operation (Ops). Practicing MLOps means that you advocate for automation and monitoring at all steps of ML system construction, including integration, testing, releasing, deployment and infrastructure management.
ML and other software systems are similar in continuous integration of source control, unit testing, integration testing, and continuous delivery of the software module or the package.
You build source code and run various tests. The outputs of this stage are pipeline components (packages, executables, and artifacts) to be deployed in a later stage.
The goal of level 1 is to perform continuous training of the model by automating the ML pipeline; this lets you achieve continuous delivery of model prediction service. To automate the process of using new data to retrain models in production, you need to introduce automated data and model validation steps to the pipeline, as well as pipeline triggers and metadata management.
For a rapid and reliable update of the pipelines in production, you need a robust automated CI/CD system. This automated CI/CD system lets your data scientists rapidly explore new ideas around feature engineering, model architecture, and hyperparameters. They can implement these ideas and automatically build, test, and deploy the new pipeline components to the target environment.

Azure and Digital Transformation: Modernize Apps, Boost Agility, and Pay Down Technical Debt.
Technical debt is a well-known problem in software development. But in complex, user-facing software like rich text editors, technical debt isn’t the only problem.
Here’s three of the many phases we worked through with the TinyMCE core engine, when identifying, prioritising, tracking and paying down our technical debt.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software. in detail, the SDLC methodology focuses on the following phases of software development:
Application performance monitoring (APM) tools can be used in a development, QA, and production environment. This keeps everyone using the same toolset across the entire development lifecycle.
IBM Engineering Lifecycle Management (ELM) is the leading platform for today’s complex product and software development. ELM extends the functionality of standard ALM tools, providing an integrated, end-to-end solution that offers full transparency and traceability across all engineering data. From requirements through testing and deployment, ELM optimizes collaboration and communication across all stakeholders, improving decision- making, productivity and overall product quality.
Enables end-to-end management of the development lifecycle.
Every phase of the SDLC life Cycle has its own process and deliverables that feed into the next phase. SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle and is also referred to as the Application Development life-cycle.
Once the system design phase is over, the next phase is coding. In this phase, developers start build the entire system by writing code using the chosen programming language. In the coding phase, tasks are divided into units or modules and assigned to the various developers. It is the longest phase of the Software Development Life Cycle process.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process for building software that ensures the quality and correctness of the software built.
A software development lifecycle (SDLC) model conceptually presents SDLC in an organized fashion to help organizations implement it. Different models arrange the SDLC phases in varying chronological order to optimize the development cycle. We look at some popular SDLC models below.
However, many organizations still lag behind when it comes to building security into their software development life cycle (SDLC).
Many secure SDLC models are in use, but one of the best known is the Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (MS SDL), which outlines 12 practices organizations can adopt to increase the security of their software. There is also the Secure Software Development Framework from the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST), which focuses on security-related processes that organizations can integrate into their existing SDLC.
We brought our own PowerApps experience and knowledge, and spoke with expert PowerApps makers across the world to collect their standards and best practices and bring them together in this document.
Here we explain why coding standards (such as C coding standards) are important, so consider this your guide to finding and using coding rules and guidelines.
Once the architectural design is complete, the next stage in the ISO 26262 standard is software unit design and implementation.

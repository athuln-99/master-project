We’ve seen how DevOps has grown from a term only familiar to technical teams to becoming part of the C-suite vocabulary.
Practices like CI/CD and automation have become the norm in every engineering organization.
Research, on behalf of Atlassian, conducted an online survey among 500 Developers & IT Decision Makers in February 2020
On call improves the work product of developers by providing the opportunity for them to experience and learn from new challenges. On-call engineers must care about how to operate the software and should have the operations skill set to triage, diagnose, and fix problems.
Traditionally, many organizations have dedicated systems admins or Ops teams responsible for running IT operations.
A relatively new role popularized by Google, site reliability engineers are software engineers who design, code, and maintain an operations function.
Senior developers get involved in on-call work as secondary responders when escalation is required.
In Companies of all sizes, including leading tech companies like Atlassian, Amazon, Google, and Netflix, expect all engineers to take on-call responsibilities to varying degrees. For example, while Amazon focuses on full ownership and expects developers to take on-call responsibilities, Google follows the principles of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and expects a healthy relationship between SRE teams and service teams (more on this later in the “Site reliability engineering approach to on call” section, below).
Google’s VP of Engineering and father of SRE, Ben Treynor, defines site reliability engineers as software engineers who design an operations function.
SAFe assumes teams are following an Agile (Scrum or Kanban) methodology.
As agile teams matured and grew, they became challenged with how to:
Scrum team is a group of individuals responsible for defining, building, and testing components/features within their agile process.
System architect/engineer is responsible for alignment with enterprise and solution architecture, and identifying and creation of solution architecture to be delivered by teams architecture.
Product management is responsible for product backlog content and prioritization.
Release train engineer is responsible for facilitating value stream and ART processes and execution including PI Planning, alignment with vision, and value stream objectives.
Product security is responsible for the security of our products and platforms.
Security intelligence is responsible for detecting and responding to security incidents.
Development and SRE are responsible for building and running tooling for the security team.
Atlassian recognizes that, at some level, security vulnerabilities are an inherent part of any software development process.
No discussion of vulnerability management would be complete without explaining the key role our product security engineers have in both ironing out bugs, and designing better irons.
Our product security engineers perform the initial triage on newly reported vulnerabilities and collaborate with our product engineering teams to identify the best fix for the issue. Our product security engineers are subject matter experts in application security and are distributed globally so that they can most effectively collaborate with our product engineers as needed.
We complete targeted code reviews, both manual and tools-assisted, and work closely with our product development teams to enhance their ability to self-detect and resolve vulnerabilities before the code reaches us.
We have an internal red team whose role is to simulate the role of adversaries attempting to identify and exploit vulnerabilities that exist within our systems, processes, and environments, so that we can ensure they are identified and addressed as promptly as possible.
While containers offer great benefits for our developers and customers in terms of being able to deploy code that can be used in a variety of environments, they can be a source of security vulnerabilities if the contents of the images consist of out-of-date or otherwise insecure libraries or components.
Our security engineers has both pro-active and re-active security roles in relation to their assigned product, including but not limited to:
The Atlassian Security Team creates alerts on our security analytics platform and monitors for indicators of compromise. Our SRE teams use this platform to monitor for availability or performance issues. Logs are retained for 30 days in hot backup, and 365 days in cold backup.
It helps IT teams free up resources with productivityenhancing capabilities such as one-touch deployments and automated patching and updates.
Tanzu Observability is also considered as an optional future add-on service that can work in conjunction with vROps but addresses a set of additional use-cases for customer development, SRE and DevOps teams.
The Tanzu Basic setup requires an estimated 120 hours for a Solution Developer to implement the solution on top of the existing VCD deployment, two additional employees to train, as well as salaries for Kubernetes admins to operate the environment.
Our target audience are any members of organizations building software including but not limited to Architects, Developers, Project/Product/Program Managers, and all those who are responsible for designing and implementing secure, cloud native products and services.
These concerns represent a shared responsibility between the developer, build team, infrastructure/cloud provider, and operating system provider.
Software producers and consumers should perform threat modeling of their systems to assess their needs and make conscious decisions about risk appetite and security controls.
Repository administrators should define who has write permissions to a code repository. In addition, administrators should define the tests and policies for coding conventions and practices. Such policies can then be implemented using a combination of client-side (precommit) and server-side hooks (pre-receive or update). In addition project codeowners, templates, .gitignore, .gitattributes and denylist files can help mitigate injection risks and provide higher assurance.
These concerns represent a shared responsibility between the developer, build team, infrastructure/cloud provider, and operating system provider.
The GoodData Enterprise Insights platform is designed to help enterprises and independent software vendors (ISVs) securely transform their data into actionable insights and deliver them to business users, customers, and partners at their point of work to drive better business outcomes.
To ensure that security is built into all aspects of the GoodData platform, the GoodData engineering team follows DevSecOps methodology. Our software engineers and operations staff are trained on secure development practices and use a wide range of technical means, which are built directly into the continuous integration infrastructure, to address risks related to code flaws and vulnerabilities as well as to prevent promotion of changes without proper review and approval.
Events related to security are evaluated, investigated and tracked to resolution by a Security Operations team, reporting directly into the Platform Delivery organization.

GoodData has established three levels of a security clearance; the highest level, which has the most demanding background check requirements and which has to be regularly renewed, is mandatory for all key security-related roles as well as for personnel with the highest level of administrative access to the GoodData platform and critical internal systems.
GoodData has appointed a dedicated information security organization led by the chief information security officer (CISO), who has the executive responsibility for information security across the corporation and leads the security and compliance department.
Additionally, endpoints of non-technical personnel have an MDM solution installed and are fully managed by the Internal IT department. Acceptable use rules are documented and communicated to all employees.
Useful approaches to increasing trust in data use and other technology include clarifying the concerns of citizens related to science (for example, big data) through workshops, and developing and improving communication tools for experts such as engineers and business operators so they consider the desirable state of technology and society together with citizens.
Data processing and cleanup can consume more than half of an analytics team’s time, including that of highly paid data scientists, which limits scalability and frustrates employees. Indeed, the productivity of employees across the organization can suffer: respondents to our 2019 Global Data Transformation Survey reported that an average of 30 percent of their total enterprise time was spent on non-value-added tasks because of poor data quality and availability (Exhibit 1).
For example, organizations can apply light governance for data that is used only in an exploration setting and not beyond the boundaries of the science team. The team may also not need perfectly prepared and integrated data with full metadata available.
Data processing and cleanup can consume more than half of an analytics team’s time, including that of highly paid data scientists, which limits scalability and frustrates employees.

Enterprise customers can upload data to the Anaplan cloud, letting the customer's business users organize and analyze disparate sets of enterprise data from finance, human resources, sales and other business units.
Begin by revisiting all the tabs in the User Access setting and set appropriate access by roles. A common mistake is granting full access to all roles, even though a specific role shouldn't have access to this complete level of items.
Grant proper access as per each role in module settings. For instance, if the role doesn’t have to do any manual input to a module, then mark it as 'Read'.
Give access only to the roles which need to add/remove/edit items in that list. It is best practice not to give access to the list for all the roles.
Breaking up the models mitigates the risk that someone accidentally was given inappropriate access by keeping finance partners in their own planning model (PBF), hiring managers in their own model (this is the largest user base in the process), and human resources and recruiting planning in their existing recruiting management model.
Anaplan offers users a cloud-based service that processes billions of spreadsheet cells of corporate data on central computers, then illustrates the results in charts and graphics within a user’s web browser.

Target tracking scaling — Increase and decrease the current capacity of the group based on a Amazon CloudWatch metric and a target value.
Simple scaling—Increase and decrease the current capacity of the group based on a single scaling adjustment, with a cooldown period between each scaling activity.
If you are scaling based on a metric that increases or decreases proportionally to the number of instances in an Auto Scaling group, we recommend that you use target tracking scaling policies. Otherwise, we recommend that you use step scaling policies.
With target tracking, an Auto Scaling group scales in direct proportion to the actual load on your application. That means that in addition to meeting the immediate need for capacity in response to load changes, a target tracking policy can also adapt to load changes that take place over time, for example, due to seasonal variations.
When you use an Auto Scaling group without any form of dynamic scaling, it doesn't scale on its own unless you set up scheduled scaling or predictive scaling.
An Auto Scaling group has a maximum capacity of 3, a current capacity of 2, and a dynamic scaling policy that adds 3 instances. When invoking this policy, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling adds only 1 instance to the group to prevent the group from exceeding its maximum size.
An Auto Scaling group has a minimum capacity of 2, a current capacity of 3, and a dynamic scaling policy that removes 2 instances. When invoking this policy, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling removes only 1 instance from the group to prevent the group from becoming less than its minimum size.
When the desired capacity reaches the maximum size limit, scaling out stops. If demand drops and capacity decreases, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can scale out again.
In this case, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can scale out above the maximum size limit, but only by up to your maximum instance weight. Its intention is to get as close to the new desired capacity as possible but still adhere to the allocation strategies that are specified for the group.
An Auto Scaling group has a maximum capacity of 12, a current capacity of 10, and a dynamic scaling policy that adds 5 capacity units.
NoSQL cloud database services, like Amazon DynamoDB, are popular for their simple key-value operations, unbounded scalability and predictable low-latency. Atomic transactions, while popular in relational databases, carry the specter of complexity and low performance, especially when used for workloads with high contention.

This simply means that the software intelligent load balancers are also used to provide actionable insights to an organization. In this section, we look at how routing is done in SDN to facilitate for intelligent load balancing. In order to appreciate the power of intelligent load balancing routing in SDN and its advantages, we first cover a summary of load balancing routing in IP networks.
Load unbalancing problem is a multi-variant, multi-constraint problem that degrades performance and efficiency of computing resources. Load balancing techniques cater the solution for load unbalancing situation for two undesirable facets- overloading and under-loading.
Load balancing is the process of redistribution of workload in a distributed system like cloud computing ensuring no computing machine is overloaded, under-loaded or idle [12, 13]. Load balancing tries to speed up different constrained parameters like response time, execution time, system stability etc. thereby improving performance of cloud [14, 15]. It is an optimization technique in which task scheduling is an NP hard problem. There are a large number of load balancing approaches proposed by researchers where most of focus has been concerned on task scheduling, task allocation, resource scheduling, resource allocation, and resource management.
Recent advances in programmable data planes, software-defined networking, and the adoption of IPv6, support novel, more complex load balancing strategies.
It has sustained the rapid global growth of Google services, and it also provides network load balancing for Google Cloud Platform.
We’ll discuss Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB) as a concrete example of large-scale load balancing, but nearly all of the best practices we describe also apply to other cloud providers’ load balancers.
Autoscale using a capacity metric as observed by the load balancer. This will automatically discount unhealthy instances from the average.
If your system becomes sufficiently complex, you may need to use more than one kind of load management. For example, you might run several managed instance groups that scale with load but are cloned across multiple regions for capacity; therefore, you also need to balance traffic between regions. In this case, your system needs to use both load balancing and load-based autoscaling.
If your site gets popular on social media and suddenly experiences a five-fold increase in traffic, you’d prefer to serve what requests you can. Therefore, you implement load shedding to drop excess traffic. In this case, your system needs to use both load balancing and load shedding.
Load balancing, load shedding, and autoscaling are all systems designed for the same goal: to equalize and stabilize the system load.
Dressy’s development teams investigate and notice a problem: their load balancing is inexplicably drawing all user traffic into region A, even though that region is full-to-overflowing and both B and C are empty (and equally large).
In brief, the load balancer didn’t know that the “efficient” requests were errors because the load shedding and load balancing systems weren’t communicating. Each system was added and enabled separately, likely by different engineers. No one had examined them as one unified load management system.
Load balancing minimizes latency by routing to the location closest to the user. Autoscaling can work together with load balancing to increase the size of locations close to the user and then route more traffic there, creating a positive feedback loop.
Autoscaling is a powerful tool, but it’s easy to get wrong. Unless carefully configured, autoscaling can result in disastrous consequences—for example, potentially catastrophic feedback cycles between load balancing, load shedding, and autoscaling when these tools are configured in isolation. As the Pokémon GO case study illustrates, traffic management works best when it’s based upon a holistic view of the interactions between systems.
Time and time again, we’ve seen that no amount of load shedding, autoscaling, or throttling will save our services when they all fail in sync.
Several techniques have been reported in the literature to improve performance and resource use based on load balancing, task scheduling, resource management, quality of service, and workload management. Load balancing in the cloud allows data centers to avoid overloading/underloading in virtual machines, which itself is a challenge in the field of cloud computing. Therefore, it becomes a necessity for developers and researchers to design and implement a suitable load balancer for parallel and distributed cloud environments.
Thus, there is a need to identify the issues that affect LBC and develop an effective load balancing technique for cloud environments.
Load balancing provides the facility to distribute the workload equally on available resources. Its objective is to provide continuous service in case of failure of any service’s component by provisioning and deprovisioning the application instances along with proper utilization of resources.
Load balancer helps in allocation of resources to the tasks fairly for resource utilization and user satisfaction at minimum cost, which motivates us to find issues in load balancing and to work on resolving them.
load balancing, there are various challenges, such as resource scheduling, performance monitoring, QoS management, energy consumption, and service availability in the cloud.
OLTP or Online Transaction Processing is a type of data processing that consists of executing a number of transactions occurring concurrently—online banking, shopping, order entry, or sending text messages, for example. These transactions traditionally are referred to as economic or financial transactions, recorded and secured so that an enterprise can access the information anytime for accounting or reporting purposes.
As IT struggles to keep pace with the speed of business, it is important that when you choose an operational database you consider your immediate data needs and long-term data requirements.
For storing transactions, maintaining systems of record, or content management, you will need a database with high concurrency, high throughput, low latency, and mission-critical characteristics such as high availability, data protection, and disaster recovery.
Also, if your data needs grow and you want to expand the functionality of your application, adding more single-purpose or fit-for-purpose databases will only create data silos and amplify the data management problems.
You must also consider other functionalities that may be necessary for your specific workload—for example, ingestion requirements, push-down compute requirements, and size at limit.
Select a future-proof cloud database service with self-service capabilities that will automate all the data management so that your data consumers—developers, analysts, data engineers, data scientists and DBAs—can do more with the data and accelerate application development.
They had to evolve to handle the modern-day transactions, heterogeneous data, and global scale, and most importantly to run mixed workloads. Relational databases transformed into multimodal databases that store and process not only relational data but also all other types of data, including xml, html, JSON, Apache Avro and Parquet, and documents in their native form, without much transformation.
The choice depends heavily on your use case — transactional processing, analytical processing, in-memory database, and so on — but it also depends on other factors. This post covers the different database options available within Google Cloud across relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases and explains which use cases are best suited for each database option.
Provides managed MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQL Server databases on Google Cloud. It reduces maintenance cost and automates database provisioning, storage capacity management, back ups, and out-of-the-box high availability and disaster recovery/failover.
Non-relational databases are often used when large quantities of complex and diverse data need to be organized, or where the structure of the data is regularly evolving to meet new business requirements. Unlike relational databases, they perform faster because a query doesn’t have to access several tables to deliver an answer, making them ideal for storing data that may change frequently or for applications that handle many different kinds of data.
Indeed, at times too much information might overwhelm the user, threatening to saturate their workload capacity, a cognitive mechanism of limited size that distributes some resources, such as working memory, to cognitive processes as required.
Minimising the amount of cognitive resources spent on this cycle has the potential to decrease the imposition of the UI on the user’s workload capacity.
Our previous research using test runs, execution time, and test input information for reliability analysis and improvement is extended to ensure better test workload measurements for reliability assessment and prediction.
However, benchmarking and comparing the energy efficiency of GPGPU workloads is challenging as standardized workloads are rare and standardized power and efficiency measurement methods and metrics do not exist. In addition, not all GPGPU systems run at maximum load all the time. Systems that are utilized in transactional, request driven workloads, for example, can run at lower utilization levels. Existing benchmarks for GPGPU systems primarily consider performance and are intended only to run at maximum load.
Generally, the providers implement an automatic provisioning approach via the virtualization technique. Virtualization makes it possible to rapidly scale the resources up or down. The aforementioned approaches present a reactive method, which is triggered by a certain threshold, such as CPU utilization or memory utilization. Actually, two or more thresholds should be used as a performance metric.
First we propose the elastic resource provisioning (ERP) approach on the performance threshold.
Thus, combining this with an automatic method and a proactive method would be more agile for provisioning the resources. For example, the Elastic VM architecture provisions the resources dynamically to reduce the SLA violation. However, the elasticity is necessary to meet the users’ demand from different perspectives.
To solve the mentioned issues, we propose the ERP approach to provision the resources by the performance threshold, including the CPU and the memory. According to the threshold, we would flexibly scale the resources up or down by considering multiple perspectives. From the perspective of the provider, the goal is aimed at minimizing the amount of the resources to reduce the energy consumption. From the perspective of the users, the goal is aimed at rapidly scaling the resources up or down.
It presents a cost-efficient method to scale up from the perspective of the providers. In contrast, our approach considers more factors to formulate the threshold by the cloud layer model, such as CPU utilization, memory utilization, etc. Additionally, we aim to scale the resources by minimizing the renting cost and response time.
Therefore, it is important to scale the resources from different granularities, including horizontal elasticity and vertical elasticity.
In fact, elasticity is essential to meet a fluctuating workload, and it is necessary to determine the suitable amount of the resources in order to scale the resources.
CloudScale is a system that automates the fine-grained resources in cloud computing infrastructures, determining the adaptive resources by the prediction.
It implements an elastic resource provisioning approach in the datacenter. This algorithm takes the performance threshold as the baseline to scale the resources up or down.
Scalability means to the ability of the system to deal with an increasing amount of the servers in a capable manner.
Automated resource provisioning techniques enable the implementation of elastic services, by adapting the available resources to the service demand. This is essential for reducing power consumption and guaranteeing QoS and SLA fulfillment, especially for those services with strict QoS requirements in terms of latency or response time, such as web servers with high traffic load, data stream processing, or real-time big data analytics. Elasticity is often implemented in cloud platforms and virtualized data-centers by means of auto-scaling mechanisms. These make automated resource provisioning decisions based on the value of specific infrastructure and/or service performance metrics.
On the other hand, service elasticity enables power consumption to be reduced, by avoiding resource over-provisioning.
The auto-scaling mechanisms should allow the system to dynamically adapt to workload changes, by autonomously provisioning and de-provisioning resources (i.e., back-end servers), so that at each point in time, the available resources match the current service demand as closely as possible.
Most control-based systems are reactive mechanisms, for example Lim et al. [30] propose extending the cloud platform with an external feedback controller that enable users to automate the resource provisioning, and introduce the concept of proportional thresholding, a new control policy that takes into account the coarse-grained actuators provided by resource providers.
Deciding where to handle services and tasks, as well as provisioning an adequate amount of computing resources for this handling, is a main challenge of edge computing systems.
We propose the concept of spare edge device to handle dynamic load changes in an elastic way, as well as algorithms for provisioning these devices with different QoS/cost tradeoffs.
In contrast to existing works, we propose a non-demand elastic resource provisioning to minimize the overall power consumption of the network (i.e., joint power consumption of the cell sites and VBS pool) while maximizing the resource utilization.
Setting a higher MTU (for example, 9000) may help to get maximum performance for all cached read workloads when using more than one disk group.
The second impact of removing the read cache is that workload performance should stay steady as the working set size is increased beyond the size of the “caching” tier SSD.
This workload can be used to understand the maximum random read I/Os per second (IOPS) that a storage solution can deliver.
In the All Read and Mixed R/W experiments, there are two important metrics to follow: I/Os per second (IOPS) and the mean latency encountered by each I/O operation.
The number of outstanding I/Os is 128 per VM for the All Read workload, and 32 per VM for the Mixed R/W workload.
The ECM Workload was executed regularly throughout the population, scaling to over 120,000 transactions per minute.
The Performance Efficiency pillar includes the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

Amazon RDS provides three storage types: General Purpose SSD (also known as gp2 and gp3), Provisioned IOPS SSD (also known as io1), and magnetic (also known as standard). They differ in performance characteristics and price, which means that you can tailor your storage performance and cost to the needs of your database workload.
You can create MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and PostgreSQL RDS DB instances with up to 64 tebibytes (TiB) of storage.
Provisioned IOPS storage is designed to meet the needs of I/O-intensive workloads, particularly database workloads, that require low I/O latency and consistent I/O throughput. Provisioned IOPS storage is best suited for production environments.
For every DB engine except RDS for SQL Server, you can provision additional IOPS and storage throughput when storage size is at or above the threshold value. For RDS for SQL Server, you can provision additional IOPS and storage throughput for any available storage size. For all DB engines, you pay for only the additional provisioned storage performance.
If your workload is unpredictable, you can enable storage autoscaling for an Amazon RDS DB instance. To do so, you can use the Amazon RDS console, the Amazon RDS API, or the AWS CLI.
Scaling up database capacity can be a tedious and risky business. Even veteran developers and database administrators who understand the nuanced behavior of their database and application perform this work cautiously. Despite the current era of sharded NoSQL clusters, increasing capacity can take hours, days, or weeks.
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed database that developers and database administrators have relied on for more than 10 years.
In June 2017, DynamoDB released auto scaling to make it easier for you to manage capacity efficiently, and auto scaling continues to help DynamoDB users lower the cost of workloads that have a predictable traffic pattern.
Before auto scaling, you would statically provision capacity in order to meet a table’s peak load plus a small buffer. In most cases, however, it isn’t cost-effective to statically provision a table above peak capacity.
When you create a DynamoDB table, auto scaling is the default capacity setting, but you can also enable auto scaling on any table that does not have it active.
It helps you identify and set up key metrics and logs across your application resources and technology stack, such as database, web (IIS) and application servers, operating system, load balancers, and queues.
Set up, operate, and scale a managed relational database in the cloud. Although you can set up a database on an EC2 instance, Amazon RDS offers the advantage of handling your database management tasks, such as patching the software, backing up, and storing the backups.
HBase is an open-source, non-relational, distributed database modeled after Google's Bigtable. It was developed as part of Apache Software Foundation's Hadoop project and runs on top of Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) to provide BigTable-like capabilities for Hadoop.
Amazon DynamoDB is a fast, fully-managed NoSQL database service that makes it simple and cost effective to store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. DynamoDB helps offload the administrative burden of operating and scaling a highly-available distributed database cluster. This storage alternative meets the latency and throughput requirements of highly demanding applications by providing single-digit millisecond latency and predictable performance with seamless throughput and storage scalability.
The first cloud data lake for enterprises that is secure, massively scalable and built to the open HDFS standard. With no limits to the size of data and the ability to run massively parallel analytics, you can now unlock value from all your unstructured, semi-structured and structured data.
Apache CouchDB (link resides outside ibm.com) is an open source NoSQL document database that collects and stores data in JSON-based document formats. Unlike relational databases, CouchDB uses a schema-free data model, which simplifies record management across various computing devices, mobile phones, and web browsers.
CouchDB is very customizable and opens the door to developing predictable and performance-driven applications regardless of your data volume or number of users.
If you don’t want to allocate a fixed number of EBS volumes at cluster creation time, use autoscaling local storage.
With autoscaling local storage, Databricks monitors the amount of free disk space available on your cluster’s Spark workers.
If a worker begins to run too low on disk, Databricks automatically attaches a new EBS volume to the worker before it runs out of disk space.
EBS volumes are attached up to a limit of 5 TB of total disk space per instance (including the instance’s local storage).
Your workloads may run more slowly because of the performance impact of reading and writing encrypted data to and from local volumes.
A 30 GB encrypted EBS instance root volume used by the host operating system and Databricks internal services.
Hadoop MapReduce is described as "a software framework for easily writing applications which process vast amounts of data (multi-terabyte data sets) in parallel on large clusters (thousands of nodes) of commodity hardware in a reliable, fault-tolerant manner."
MapReduce filters and sorts data while converting it into key-value pairs.
By using Spark's distributed computation engine, the package allows users to run large scale data analysis such as selection, filtering, aggregation from R. Karau et al. (2015) provides a summary of the state-of-the-art on using Spark.
When the amount of data in a company reaches a particularly large volume, increases rapidly and includes diverse data formats, this is referred to as a big data scenario.
When the data volume achieves a magnitude of about 100 TB, specialized and optimized relational database systems reach their architectural and technical limits. As the volume of data increases, so does the effort required to keep the data operationally available and consistent. Relational databases of this size are customized and require cost-intensive hardware.
Storage volumes remain available during this scaling-up operation.
OpenSearch Service supports 1 EBS volume (max size of 1.5 TB) per instance associated with a domain. With the default maximum of 20 data nodes allowed per OpenSearch Service domain, you can allocate about 30 TB of EBS storage to a single domain.
If successful, they would like to expand this offering to their consumer line as well, with a much larger volume and a greater market share.
The expansion of IoT, connected devices and people is generating volumes of data that exceed the storage capacity of any traditional database system. This new type of data is often in formats that are not suitable for storing in relational database tables or for querying using relational query semantics.
But as the volume of data continues to grow exponentially, managing backup and recovery and meeting strict protection service-level objectives (SLOs) has become increasingly challenging.
Its performance for high volume, low latency transactions and data ingestion exceeds the read and write performance and scalability of traditional databases. Ignite can sit on top of all these databases at the same time as an IMDG and coordinate transactions in-memory with the underlying databases to ensure data is never lost.
PayPal, an eBay company, has used Hadoop and other software tools to detect fraud, but the colossal volumes of data were so large their systems were unable to perform the analysis quickly enough.
The problem is, as data volumes grow, querying against a huge, centrally located data set becomes slow and inefficient, and performance suffers.
One estimate is that 80% of all data today is unstructured; unstructured data is growing 15 times faster than structured data4 and the total volume of data is expected to grow to 40 zettabytes (10^21 bytes) by 2020.
And the number of data engineers sought by companies has recently seen a 96% year-over-year change. But hiring alone is not enough to manage the increase in data volume.
An increasing amount of data is generated and collected across machines, enterprises and applications in unstructured or non-relational format. These data types are characterized not just by the large volumes, but also by their velocity, variety and variability. “Data drifting” is a term that is now commonly used to depict the fluctuation in the format, the pace and the content of data in these new data types.
Based on continuous observation of resource utilization trends, data-volume processing projections are offered to help with capacity planning. CLAIRE takes this to the next step by offering auto-scaling of data management runtime resources.
However, high volumes of low cost data on low cost hardware should not be misinterpreted as a signal for reduced service level agreement (SLA) expectations.
Particularly for SAN performance, some storage vendors say that imposing any type of data layout overhead on the data volume reduces performance.
One of the features of Data ONTAP that NetApp users consistently comment on is the ability to nondisruptively grow and shrink data volumes as needs change. For example, you can provision a data volume for use with either NAS or SAN protocols and grow it over time to meet changing needs.
A higher priority gives a volume a greater percentage of available resources when a system is fully loaded.
For example, Leuven University Hospital (UZ Leuven) consolidated all its critical Sybase database storage along with storage used by less critical SQL Server applications on a single set of NetApp storage systems.
Big Data requires processing high volumes of low-density data, that is, data of unknown value, such as twitter data feeds, clicks on a web page, network traffic, sensor-enabled equipment capturing data at the speed of light, and many more. It is the task of Big Data to convert low-density data into high-density data, that is, data that has value. For some companies, this might be tens of terabytes, for others it may be hundreds of petabytes.
By leveraging Oracle Exadata for your data warehouse, processing can be enhanced with flash memory, columnar databases, in-memory databases, and more.
Oracle NoSQL Database is designed as a highly scalable, distributed database based on Oracle Berkeley DB. Sleepycat Software. Oracle NoSQL Database is a general purpose, enterprise class key value store that adds an intelligent driver on top of an enhanced distributed Berkeley database.
Its performance for high volume, low latency transactions and data ingestion exceeds the read and write performance and scalability of traditional databases.
An Ignite cluster can also be used as a distributed, transactional IMDB to support high volume, low latency transactions, and data ingestion, or for low-cost storage.
Kafka on your own, you need to provision servers, configure Apache Kafka manually, replace servers when they fail, orchestrate server patches and upgrades, architect the cluster for high availability, ensure data is durably stored and secured, set up monitoring and alarms, and carefully plan scaling events to support load changes.
Several teams of scientists run complex applications to analyze subsets of those huge volumes of data.
When the volume of data to be analyzed is of the order of terabytes or petabytes (billions of tweets or posts), scalable storage and computing solutions must be used, but no clear solutions today exist for the analysis of Exascale datasets.
Indeed, processing very large data volumes requires operations and new algorithms able to scale in loading, storing, and processing massive amounts of data that generally must be partitioned in very small data grains, on which thousands to millions of simple parallel operations do analysis.
Moving to social media applications, nowadays the huge volume of user-generated data in social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, are very precious sources of data from which to extract insights concerning human dynamics and behaviors.
In-memory querying and analytics needed to reduce query response times and execution of analytics operations by caching large volumes of data in the computing node RAMs and issuing queries and other operation in parallel on the main memory of computing nodes.
As Exascale systems are likely to be based on large distributed memory hardware, MPI is one of the most natural programming systems.
On the other side, we have shared-memory models where the major system is OpenMP that offers a simple parallel programming model although it does not provide mechanisms to explicitly map and control data distribution and includes non-scalable synchronization operations that are making very challenging its implementation on massively parallel systems.
General issues like energy consumption, multitasking, scheduling, reproducibility, and resiliency must be addressed together with other data-oriented issues like data distribution and mapping, data access, data communication and synchronization.
ata locality mechanisms/constructs, like near-data computing must be designed and evaluated on big data applications when subsets of data are stored in nearby processors and by avoiding that locality is imposed when data must be moved. Other challenges concern data affinity control data querying (NoSQL approach), global data distribution and sharing patterns.
In order to resolve the contradiction between requirements of high performance and limited memory resource, we propose a scalable Main-Memory database system ScaMMDB which distributes data and operations to several nodes and makes good use of every node’s resource.
The system must be able to scale with the growth in data size and query volume. For example, it must support trillions of rows and petabytes of data. The update and query performance must hold even as these parameters grow significantly.
Mesa is Google's solution to these technical and operational challenges. Even though subsets of these requirements are solved by existing data warehousing systems, Mesa is unique in solving all of these problems simultaneously for business critical data. Mesa is a distributed, replicated, and highly available data processing, storage, and query system for structured data. Mesa ingests data generated by upstream services, aggregates and persists the data internally, and serves the data via user queries. Even though this paper mostly discusses Mesa in the context of ads metrics, Mesa is a generic data warehousing solution that satisfies all of the above requirements.
Napa: Powering Scalable Data Warehousing with Robust Query Performance at Google.
We need to store and serve these planet-scale data sets under extremely demanding requirements of scalability, sub-second query response times, availability even in the case of entire data center failures, strong consistency guarantees, ingesting a massive stream of updates coming from the applications used around the globe. We have developed and deployed in production an analytical data management system, called Napa, to meet these requirements.
At its core, Napa’s principal technologies for robust query performance include the aggressive use of materialized views that are maintained consistently as new data is ingested across multiple data centers. Our clients also demand flexibility in being able to adjust their query performance, data freshness, and costs to suit their unique needs. Robust query processing and flexible configuration of client databases are the hallmark of Napa design.
Charged with serving as the Federal lifeline for millions of citizens who need immediate help in the face of life-threatening disasters, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is working with Google Cloud services to run its data management system more efficiently, securely, and collaboratively.
Data unification allows for a single source of information in one repository, creating a shared ecosystem of large amounts of data that users can leverage in real time.
The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) STRIDES program and NCI Imaging Data Commons are using Google Cloud to help accelerate research productivity with purpose built, scalable data management tools.
NEON was designed for the grand challenges in ecology and Paula Mabee shared how they are partnering with Google to collect and manage over 400 terabytes of raw data per year across 182 data products to accelerate discoveries and help get these important data and knowledge to the into the hands of scientists and decision makers.
Photon is deployed within Google Advertising System to join data streams such as web search queries and user clicks on advertisements. It produces joined logs that are used to derive key business metrics, including billing for advertisers. Our production deployment processes millions of events per minute at peak with an average end-to-end latency of less than 10 seconds.
Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer “siloed.” Sometimes, these two teams are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function.
In some DevOps models, quality assurance and security teams may also become more tightly integrated with development and operations and throughout the application lifecycle. When security is the focus of everyone on a DevOps team, this is sometimes referred to as DevSecOps.
These teams use practices to automate processes that historically have been manual and slow. They use a technology stack and tooling which help them operate and evolve applications quickly and reliably. These tools also help engineers independently accomplish tasks (for example, deploying code or provisioning infrastructure) that normally would have required help from other teams, and this further increases a team’s velocity.
The DevOps model enables your developers and operations teams to achieve these results. For example, microservices and continuous delivery let teams take ownership of services and then release updates to them quicker.
Operate and manage your infrastructure and development processes at scale. Automation and consistency help you manage complex or changing systems efficiently and with reduced risk. For example, infrastructure as code helps you manage your development, testing, and production environments in a repeatable and more efficient manner.
Developers and operations teams collaborate closely, share many responsibilities, and combine their workflows. This reduces inefficiencies and saves time (e.g. reduced handover periods between developers and operations, writing code that takes into account the environment in which it is run).
Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. It expands upon continuous integration by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and/or a production environment after the build stage. When continuous delivery is implemented properly, developers will always have a deployment-ready build artifact that has passed through a standardized test process.
You're familiar with creating and managing IAM users, roles, and policies. You want to ensure that your development engineers and quality assurance team members can access the resources they need. You also need a strategy that scales as your company grows.
AWS customers are welcome to carry out security assessments or penetration tests of their AWS infrastructure without prior approval for the services listed in the next section under “Permitted Services.” Additionally, AWS permits customers to host their security assessment tooling within the AWS IP space or other cloud provider for on-prem, in AWS, or third party contracted testing. All security testing that includes Command and Control (C2) requires prior approval.
AWS's policy regarding the use of security assessment tools and services allows significant flexibility for performing security assessments of your AWS assets while protecting other AWS customers and ensuring quality-of-service across AWS.
Customers wishing to perform a DDoS simulation test should review our DDoS Simulation Testing policy.
Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor monitors the quality of Amazon SageMaker machine learning models in production.
With Model Monitor, you can set alerts that notify you when there are deviations in the model quality.
Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor automatically monitors machine learning (ML) models in production and notifies you when quality issues arise.
In this blog post, we introduce Deequ, an open source tool developed and used at Amazon. Deequ allows you to calculate data quality metrics on your dataset, define and verify data quality constraints, and be informed about changes in the data distribution.
Deequ is implemented on top of Apache Spark and is designed to scale with large datasets (think billions of rows) that typically live in a distributed filesystem or a data warehouse.
Deequ computes data quality metrics, that is, statistics such as completeness, maximum, or correlation. Deequ uses Spark to read from sources such as Amazon S3, and to compute metrics through an optimized set of aggregation queries.
AWS’s strategy for design and development of AWS services is to clearly define services in terms of customer use cases, service performance, marketing and distribution requirements, production and testing, and legal and regulatory requirements.
In addition to the software, hardware, human resource and real estate assets that are encompassed in the scope of the AWS quality management system supporting the development and operations of AWS services, it also includes documented information including, but not limited to source code, system documentation and operational policies and procedures.
AWS implements formal, documented policies and procedures that provide guidance for operations and information security within the organization and the supporting AWS environments. Policies address purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities and management commitment. All policies are maintained in a centralized location that is accessible by employees.
The AWS quality system is documented to ensure that planning is consistent with all other requirements.
AWS continuously monitors service usage to project infrastructure needs to support availability commitments and requirements. AWS maintains a capacity planning model to assess infrastructure usage and demands at least monthly, and usually more frequently. In addition, the AWS capacity planning model supports the planning of future demands to acquire and implement additional resources based upon current resources and forecasted requirements.
It's important to run controlled tests and monitor the same environment or workstation as those reporting the issue, and be able to reproduce the same use cases. Consider the following general testing recommendations for measuring and gathering data to investigate voice quality issues.
To ensure the ultimate level of security, you need to integrate health checks into your workflow, and DevOps is the best method of achieving this goal. Amazon Inspector is one of the AWS tools for testers that is delivered as a service that facilitates an easier adoption into the existing DevOps process. DevSecOps extends DevOps with QA and entails continuous communication among operational teams, developers, and testers.
We can help you integrate continuous testing into your pipeline, eliminate human errors, and automate deployments. In our experience, going through test automation implementation helps companies to validate their current QA processes and improve test accuracy. Finally, test automation services reduces time-to-market and delivers a high-quality product with fewer bugs.
The modern tools and techniques of application validation can simplify the testing process, shorten time-to-market, keep money in the budget, and enhance product quality.
Amazon CodeGuru Security is a static application security testing (SAST) tool that combines machine learning (ML) and automated reasoning to identify vulnerabilities in your code, provide recommendations on how to fix the identified vulnerabilities, and track the status of the vulnerabilities until closure.
To begin reviewing code, you can associate your existing code repositories on GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, Bitbucket, or AWS CodeCommit in the CodeGuru console.
Incorporating CodeGuru in our development workflows improves and automates code reviews, helps our DevOps teams proactively identify and fix functional and non-functional issues and ensures that the deployments exceeds the performance, security and compliance requirements of our customers across industries and regions.
With CodeGuru, we have built automated code reviews directly into our pipelines, which means my team can deploy code faster and with more confidence. We use CodeGuru Reviewer’s recommendations based on ML and automated reasoning, to focus on fixing and improving the code, instead of manually finding flaws. The addition of Python has made CodeGuru even more accessible for us.
Amazon CodeGuru has helped expedite our software development lifecycle by streamlining the code review process. As the primary code reviewer on the team, I can now focus more on the functionality and feature implementation of the code as opposed to searching for security vulnerabilities and best practices that may not have been followed.
At Atlassian, many of our services have hundreds of check-ins per deployment. While code reviews from our development team do a great job of preventing bugs from reaching production, it’s not always possible to predict how systems will behave under stress or manage complex data shapes, especially as we have multiple deployments per day.
Integrate CodeGuru into your existing software development workflow to automate code reviews during application development and continuously monitor application's performance in production and provide recommendations and visual clues on how to improve code quality, application performance, and reduce overall cost.
AWS provides the AWS Well-Architected Tool to help you review your approach prior to development, the state of your workloads prior to production, and the state of your workloads in production. You can compare workloads to the latest AWS architectural best practices, monitor their overall status, and gain insight into potential risks.
Oracle is uniquely positioned and qualified to deliver and support open source software by eliminating risk through supporting the binaries from open source projects. In addition, Oracle implements rigorous methodology and proven processes to ensure that the open source software meets or exceeds specifications by subjecting it to the same standards, quality assurance, and interoperability testing as Oracle’s commercial software.
At a high level, cloud-native architecture means adapting to the many new possibilities—but very different set of architectural constraints—offered by the cloud compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure.
While the functional aspects don't change too much, the cloud offers, and sometimes requires, very different ways to meet non-functional requirements, and imposes very different architectural constraints. If architects fail to adapt their approach to these different constraints, the systems they architect are often fragile, expensive, and hard to maintain. A well-architected cloud native system, on the other hand, should be largely self-healing, cost efficient, and easily updated and maintained through Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD).
Automation has always been a best practice for software systems, but cloud makes it easier than ever to automate the infrastructure as well as components that sit above it.
Automated processes can repair, scale, deploy your system far faster than people can.
Infrastructure: Automate the creation of the infrastructure, together with updates to it, using tools like Google Cloud Deployment Manager or Terraform
Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery: Automate the build, testing, and deployment of the packages that make up the system by using tools like Google Cloud Build, Jenkins and Spinnaker. Not only should you automate the deployment, you should strive to automate processes like canary testing and rollback.
Scale up and scale down: Unless your system load almost never changes, you should automate the scale up of the system in response to increases in load, and scale down in response to sustained drops in load. By scaling up, you ensure your service remains available, and by scaling down you reduce costs.
In this post we set out five principles of cloud-native architecture that will help to ensure your designs take full advantage of the cloud while avoiding the pitfalls of shoe-horning old approaches into a new platform.
The development and integration of the new software components into the existing open source software application is a major constraint.
Resources can be provisioned as temporary, disposable units, freeing users from the inflexibility and constraints of a fixed and finite IT infrastructure.
Reducing power consumption will require adding architectural improvements to process and circuit improvements. Thus, elevating power to a first-class constraint must be a priority early in the design stage when architectural tradeoffs are made as designers perform cycle-accurate simulation.
Multi-objective optimizations were performed based on actual design constraints.
With accelerator-based designs, we are able to build an end-to-end autonomous driving system that meets all the design constraints, and explore the trade-offs among performance, power and the higher accuracy enabled by higher resolution cameras.
The solution architect must understand all these constraints, compare them, and then make a number of technological and managerial decisions to reconcile these restrictions with project goals.
To that end, the data indicate that organizational culture and modern development processes (such as continuous integration) are the biggest drivers of an organization’s software security and are the best place to start for organizations looking to improve their security posture.
CI plays an increasingly important role in DevOps, allowing enterprises to drive quality from the start of their development cycle.
Today, we are honored to share that Cloud Build, Google Cloud’s continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) platform, was named a Leader in The Forrester Wave™: Cloud-Native Continuous Integration Tools, Q3 2019. The report identifies the 10 CI providers that matter most for continuous integration (CI) and how they stack up on 27 criterias.
OSS-Fuzz offers CIFuzz, a GitHub action/CI job that runs your fuzz targets on pull requests. This works similarly to running unit tests in CI. CIFuzz helps you find and fix bugs before they make it into your codebase. Currently, CIFuzz primarily supports projects hosted on GitHub. Non-OSS-Fuzz users can use CIFuzz with additional features through ClusterFuzzLite.
Lighthouse CI is a suite of tools for using Lighthouse during continuous integration. Lighthouse CI can be incorporated into developer workflows in many different ways.
Lighthouse CI shows how these findings have changed over time. This can be used to identify the impact of particular code changes or ensure that performance thresholds are met during continuous integration processes. Although performance monitoring is the most common use case for Lighthouse CI, it can be used to monitor other aspects of the Lighthouse report - for example, SEO or accessibility.
Speed, Scale, And Security Are The Important Differentiators As organizations transition to continuous delivery (CD) and shift hosting of production workloads to cloud servers, traditional, on-premises continuous integration will no longer suffice. Cloud-native CI products with exceptional build speed, on-demand scale, and secure configurations will lead the market and enable customers to accelerate delivery speed and lower management costs, all while meeting corporate compliance needs.
Continuous integration (CI) systems automate the compilation, building, and testing of software. Despite CI rising as a big success story in automated software engineering, it has received almost no attention from the research community.
Continuous Integration (CI) is emerging as one of the biggest success stories in automated software engineering. CI systems automate the compilation, building, testing and deployment of software.
This document discusses techniques for implementing and automating continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), and continuous training (CT) for machine learning (ML) systems.
This document is for data scientists and ML engineers who want to apply DevOps principles to ML systems (MLOps). MLOps is an ML engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying ML system development (Dev) and ML system operation (Ops). Practicing MLOps means that you advocate for automation and monitoring at all steps of ML system construction, including integration, testing, releasing, deployment and infrastructure management.
DevOps is a popular practice in developing and operating large-scale software systems. This practice provides benefits such as shortening the development cycles, increasing deployment velocity, and dependable releases. To achieve these benefits, you introduce two concepts in the software system development: Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD)
ML and other software systems are similar in continuous integration of source control, unit testing, integration testing, and continuous delivery of the software module or the package.
You build source code and run various tests. The outputs of this stage are pipeline components (packages, executables, and artifacts) to be deployed in a later stage.
In this level, your system continuously delivers new pipeline implementations to the target environment that in turn delivers prediction services of the newly trained model. For rapid and reliable continuous delivery of pipelines and models, you should consider the following:
Rather, it means deploying an ML pipeline that can automate the retraining and deployment of new models. Setting up a CI/CD system enables you to automatically test and deploy new pipeline implementations. This system lets you cope with rapid changes in your data and business environment.
You can gradually implement these practices to help improve the automation of your ML system development and production.
The goal of level 1 is to perform continuous training of the model by automating the ML pipeline; this lets you achieve continuous delivery of model prediction service. To automate the process of using new data to retrain models in production, you need to introduce automated data and model validation steps to the pipeline, as well as pipeline triggers and metadata management.
The steps of the ML experiment are orchestrated. The transition between steps is automated, which leads to rapid iteration of experiments and better readiness to move the whole pipeline to production.
CT of the model in production: The model is automatically trained in production using fresh data based on live pipeline triggers, which are discussed in the next section.
Therefore, automated data validation and model validation steps are required in the production pipeline to ensure the following expected behavior:
An optional additional component for level 1 ML pipeline automation is a feature store.
For a rapid and reliable update of the pipelines in production, you need a robust automated CI/CD system. This automated CI/CD system lets your data scientists rapidly explore new ideas around feature engineering, model architecture, and hyperparameters. They can implement these ideas and automatically build, test, and deploy the new pipeline components to the target environment.

Visual Studio Team System (VSTS) 2010 introduces new features and capabilities to help agile teams with planning. In this article I will introduce you to the new product backlog and iteration backlog workbooks and a set of new reports that will help agile teams plan and manage releases and iterations.
Agile supports Agile planning methods (learn more about Agile methodologies at the Agile Alliance), including Scrum, and tracks development and test activities separately. This process works great if you want to track user stories and (optionally) bugs on the Kanban board, or track bugs and tasks on the Taskboard.
Azure Boards offers predefined work item types for tracking features, user stories, bugs, and tasks, making it easy to start using your product backlog or Kanban board. It supports different Agile methods, so you can implement the method that suits you best. You can add teams as your organization grows to give them the autonomy to track their work as they see fit.
For example, if you update a record in Microsoft Azure DevOps, the update is reflected in Agile Development. Similarly, if you update a record in Agile Development, the update is reflected in Microsoft Azure DevOps.
The Integration of Microsoft Azure DevOps with Agile Development enables you to do the following: View available Microsoft Azure DevOps projects in Agile Development. Perform a bulk import of records from Microsoft Azure DevOps to Agile Development. Perform single record updates between Microsoft Azure DevOps and Agile Development. Avoid duplicating record update entries in Microsoft Azure DevOps and Agile Development.
Plan, track, and update your tasks from a single application.
Consider managing your bug bar and technical debt as part of your team's overall set of continuous improvement activities. You may find these resources of interest:
While bugs contribute to technical debt, they may not represent all debt.
Poor software design, poorly written code, or short-term fixes can all contribute to technical debt. Technical debt reflects extra development work that arises from all these problems.
Track work to address technical debt as PBIs, user stories, or bugs. To track a team's progress in incurring and addressing technical debt, you'll want to consider how to categorize the work item and the details you want to track.
Scrum Masters help build and maintain healthy teams by employing Scrum processes. They guide, coach, teach, and assist Scrum teams in the proper employment of Scrum methods. Scrum Masters also act as change agents to help teams overcome impediments and to drive the team toward significant productivity increases.
Daily Scrum meetings help keep a team focused on what it needs to do the next day. Staying focused helps the team maximize their ability to meet sprint commitments. Your Scrum Master should enforce the structure of the meeting and ensure that it starts on time and finishes in 15 minutes or less.
The diagram below details the iterative Scrum lifecycle. The entire lifecycle is completed in fixed time periods called sprints. A sprint is typically one-to-four weeks long.
The product owner is responsible for what the team builds, and why they build it. The product owner is responsible for keeping the backlog of work up to date and in priority order
The Scrum master ensures that the Scrum process is followed by the team. Scrum masters are continually on the lookout for how the team can improve, while also resolving impediments and other blocking issues that arise during the sprint. Scrum masters are part coach, part team member, and part cheerleader.
The product backlog is a prioritized list of work the team can deliver. The product owner is responsible for adding, changing, and reprioritizing the backlog as needed. The items at the top of the backlog should always be ready for the team to execute on.
The team takes time to reflect on what went well and which areas need improvement. The outcome of the retrospective are actions for the next sprint.
The entire cycle is repeated for the next sprint. Sprint planning selects the next items on the product backlog and the cycle repeats. While the team executes the sprint, the product owner ensures the items at the top of the backlog are ready to execute in the following sprint.
Modernizing your applications and other elements of your IT environment can help reduce technical debt in your current infrastructure and free time and budget for strategic projects that support business initiatives.
Technical debt refers to the side effects of prioritising time, money, and workarounds over quality in the delivery of enterprise IT.
Plan an integrated organisation-wide approach to remediation; review and update often. Consider the aspects of technical debt that you may be introducing with every new “go live” .
IDC predicts that through 2023, coping with technical debt accumulated during the pandemic will challenge 50% of CIOs. This technical debt is a result of what were imperative but necessarily fast-tracked implementations of solutions for new, remote working arrangements after the onset of COVID-19.
Investing in right sizing enterprise cloud environments and integrating these with older stop-gap solutions will help minimise the burden of technical debt.
Azure and Digital Transformation: Modernize Apps, Boost Agility, and Pay Down Technical Debt.
Technical debt is a well-known problem in software development. But in complex, user-facing software like rich text editors, technical debt isn’t the only problem.
User satisfaction, value delivered and product marketability are as dependent on UI/UX as performance, and that’s where functional debt poses a threat. And similarly to technical debt, functional debt is hard to identify and pay down.
Technical debt is about how a feature was implemented.
Engineers tend to notice technical debt. Designers more likely notice functional debt.
Here’s three of the many phases we worked through with the TinyMCE core engine, when identifying, prioritising, tracking and paying down our technical debt.
As manual processes are digitized and automated, operational overheads and protocols only increase complexity and technical debt, resulting in applications and networks that incur hidden costs and unexpected externalities.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software. in detail, the SDLC methodology focuses on the following phases of software development:
SDLC or the Software Development Life Cycle is a process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time possible. SDLC provides a well-structured flow of phases that help an organization to quickly produce high-quality software which is well-tested and ready for production use.
It’s also important to know that there is a strong focus on the testing phase. As the SDLC is a repetitive methodology, you have to ensure code quality at every cycle. Many organizations tend to spend few efforts on testing while a stronger focus on testing can save them a lot of rework, time, and money. Be smart and write the right types of tests.
Application performance monitoring (APM) tools can be used in a development, QA, and production environment. This keeps everyone using the same toolset across the entire development lifecycle.
The Agile SDLC model separates the product into cycles and delivers a working product very quickly. This methodology produces a succession of releases. Testing of each release feeds back info that’s incorporated into the next version.
The application development life cycle management (ADLM) tool market focuses on the planning and governance activities of the software development life cycle (SDLC). ADLM products focus on the "development" portion of an application's life.
IBM Engineering Lifecycle Management (ELM) is the leading platform for today’s complex product and software development. ELM extends the functionality of standard ALM tools, providing an integrated, end-to-end solution that offers full transparency and traceability across all engineering data. From requirements through testing and deployment, ELM optimizes collaboration and communication across all stakeholders, improving decision- making, productivity and overall product quality.
Get integrated testing and lifecycle traceability that provide visibility across artifacts for a complete view of development, to ensure the product meets all requirements and is fully tested.
Enables end-to-end management of the development lifecycle.
Every phase of the SDLC life Cycle has its own process and deliverables that feed into the next phase. SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle and is also referred to as the Application Development life-cycle.
Once the system design phase is over, the next phase is coding. In this phase, developers start build the entire system by writing code using the chosen programming language. In the coding phase, tasks are divided into units or modules and assigned to the various developers. It is the longest phase of the Software Development Life Cycle process.
The SDLC life cycle process is repeated, with each release adding more functionality until all requirements are met. In this method, every cycle act as the maintenance phase for the previous software release. Modification to the incremental model allows development cycles to overlap. After that subsequent cycle may begin before the previous cycle is complete.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process for building software that ensures the quality and correctness of the software built.
The full form SDLC is Software Development Life Cycle or Systems Development Life Cycle.
A software development lifecycle (SDLC) model conceptually presents SDLC in an organized fashion to help organizations implement it. Different models arrange the SDLC phases in varying chronological order to optimize the development cycle. We look at some popular SDLC models below.
The agile model arranges the SDLC phases into several development cycles. The team iterates through the phases rapidly, delivering only small, incremental software changes in each cycle. They continuously evaluate requirements, plans, and results so that they can respond quickly to change. The agile model is both iterative and incremental, making it more efficient than other process models.
Rapid development cycles help teams identify and address issues in complex projects early on and before they become significant problems. They can also engage customers and stakeholders to obtain feedback throughout the project lifecycle.
In traditional software development, security testing was a separate process from the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
DevSecOps is the practice of integrating security testing at every stage of the software development process. It includes tools and processes that encourage collaboration between developers, security specialists, and operation teams to build software that can withstand modern threats. In addition, it ensures that security assurance activities such as code review, architecture analysis, and penetration testing are integral to development efforts.
The abbreviation SDLC can sometimes refer to the systems development lifecycle, the process for planning and creating an IT system.
Having achieved some understanding of the Project Management and System Development lifecycles, and having learned to discern relative value of their multitudinous deliverables, we are now well positioned to come up with a sequence of milestones that can communicate the status of the project in a fashion meaningful to the Project and Executive Sponsor layers of the organization.
However, many organizations still lag behind when it comes to building security into their software development life cycle (SDLC).
The later a bug is found in the SDLC, the more expensive it becomes to fix. When a bug is found late in the cycle, developers must drop the work they are doing, and go back to revisit code they may have written weeks ago. Even worse, when a bug is found in production, the code gets sent all the way back to the beginning of the SDLC.
Many secure SDLC models are in use, but one of the best known is the Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (MS SDL), which outlines 12 practices organizations can adopt to increase the security of their software. There is also the Secure Software Development Framework from the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST), which focuses on security-related processes that organizations can integrate into their existing SDLC.
PowerApps canvas app coding standards and guidelines.
This white paper was developed as a collaboration between the Microsoft PowerApps team, Microsoft IT, and industry professionals. Of course, enterprise customers are free to develop their own standards and practices. However, we feel that adherence to these guidelines will help developers in these areas:
We brought our own PowerApps experience and knowledge, and spoke with expert PowerApps makers across the world to collect their standards and best practices and bring them together in this document.
The standards and guidelines are targeted at the enterprise application maker (developer) who is responsible for designing, building, testing, deploying, and maintaining PowerApps apps in a small business, corporate, or government environment.
Coding standards are collections of coding rules, guidelines, and best practices. Using the right one — such as C coding standards and C++ coding standards — will help you write cleaner code.
Here we explain why coding standards (such as C coding standards) are important, so consider this your guide to finding and using coding rules and guidelines.
The reason why coding standards are important is that they help to ensure safety, security, and reliability. Every development team should use one. Even the most experienced developer could introduce a coding defect — without realizing it. And that one defect could lead to a minor glitch.
Using C coding standards is a smart way to find undefined and unpredictable behaviors.
There are several established standards. Some are specifically designed for functional safety — such as MISRA. Others are focused on secure coding, including CERT.
Adoption and management of coding standards (e.g. MISRA) at large scale in complex codebases.
Synopsys is also involved as a member in formulating the SAE J3061 and ISO 21434 standards, which define comprehensive strategies for automotive cybersecurity.
Coverity allows the enforcement of commonly used language subsets and coding standards – e.g. MISRA C/C++, AUTOSAR C++, CERT C/C++, and others.
While coding standards such as MISRA will restrict the available concurrency functions available for use, Coverity includes a number of built-in checks specifically targeted at finding concurrency related errors including deadlocks, resource exhaustion, and inconsistent usage of locking and thread management routines.
Once the architectural design is complete, the next stage in the ISO 26262 standard is software unit design and implementation.
The standard supplies numerous guidelines for software design and implementation to ensure the correct order of execution, consistency of interfaces, correctness of data flow and control flow, simplicity, readability and comprehensibility, and robustness.
Such changes in the health environment will be taken into account as AHIMA proceeds toward an updated coding productivity standard.
Overall, AHIMA has provided multiple coding standard examples for ICD-10-CM/PCS for inpatient records.

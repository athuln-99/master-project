Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling supports the following types of dynamic scaling policies:
Step scaling—Increase and decrease the current capacity of the group based on a set of scaling adjustments, known as step adjustments, that vary based on the size of the alarm breach.
Amazon Aurora features a distributed, fault-tolerant, self-healing storage system that auto-scales up to 128TB per database instance. It delivers high performance and availability with up to 15 low-latency read replicas, point-in-time recovery, continuous backup to Amazon S3, and replication across three Availability Zones (AZs).
It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups.
These data lake applications achieve single-instance transfer rates that maximize the network interface use for their Amazon EC2 instance, which can be up to 100 Gb/s on a single instance.
These applications then aggregate throughput across multiple instances to get multiple terabits per second.
Auto Scaling is a service that enables you to automatically scale your Amazon EC2 capacity up or down according to conditions that you define. With Auto Scaling, you can ensure that the number of EC2 instances you’re using scales up seamlessly during demand spikes to maintain performance, and scales down automatically during demand lulls to minimize costs.
Each shard gives you a capacity of five read transactions per second, up to a maximum total of 2 MB of data read per second. Each shard can support up to 1,000 write transactions per second, and up to a maximum total of 1 MB data written per second.
With each shard in an Amazon Kinesis stream, you can capture up to 1 megabyte per second of data at 1,000 write transactions per second.
Amazon Kinesis Data Streams enables you to choose the throughput capacity you require in terms of shards.
Long-term data storage and analytics – Kinesis Data Streams is not suited for long-term data storage. By default, data is retained for 24 hours, and you can extend the retention period by up to 365 days.
Azure Monitor supports your operations at scale by helping you maximize the performance and availability of your resources and proactively identify problems.
When data volume rapidly grows, Hadoop quickly scales to accommodate the demand via Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). In turn, Spark relies on the fault tolerant HDFS for large volumes of data.
Load balancing enables scalability, avoids bottlenecks and also reduces time taken to give the respond. Many load balancing algorithm [2] have been designed in order to schedule the load among various machines. But so far there is no such ideal load balancing algorithm has been developed which will allocate the load evenly across the system.
Currently, load balancing in the cloud (LBC) is one of the main challenges that allows avoiding the situation of overloading/underloading in virtual machines during task computation.
Workload capacity is the construct we have used to refer to the cognitive mechanism underpinning multitasking.
Cloud computing is popular in industry due to its ability to deliver on-demand resources according to a pay-as-you-go model.
In the automatic policy, the resources would be provisioned and released automatically according to the demand. Generally, the action is triggered by the fixed thresholds, such as the utilization. The common techniques are provided by Amazon and Scalr. However, they provision the resources only based on the utilization, when in fact more elements have taken effect.
PRESS is a predictive elasticity system that analyzes and extracts the workload patterns and provisions the resources automatically.
Similar scalability is observed in the sequential read and write workloads. Note that the Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) was set as 9000 to the Virtual SAN network interfaces to get maximum performance for the two disk group configuration for the All Read workload. This is mainly to reduce the CPU utilization consumed by the vSphere network stack at such high loads.
DB instances for Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes for database and log storage.
In some cases, your database workload might not be able to achieve 100 percent of the IOPS that you have provisioned.
It delivers low-latency performance at any scale and greatly simplifies database capacity management.
Amazon EBS provides two volume types: standard volumes and Provisioned IOPS volumes. They differ in performance characteristics and pricing model, allowing you to tailor your storage performance and cost to the needs of your applications. You can attach and stripe across multiple volumes of either type to increase the I/O performance available to your Amazon EC2 applications.
How can companies support 10-1000x increases in query and transaction volumes, leverage 50x as much data for decision making, and do everything that used to take hours or days in seconds or fractions of a second?
Analogous to the clustering of multiple database servers in Oracle® Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC), storage resources across multiple storage controllers can be employed to deliver much greater I/O performance to an application than a single storage controller could achieve alone.
Spark or MapReduce processing of high volume, high variety data from multiple data sources and then reduce and optimize dataset to calculate risk profiles.
It automates most of the common administrative tasks associated with provisioning, configuring, monitoring, backing up, and securing a data warehouse, making it easy and inexpensive to manage and maintain. This automation enables you to build petabyte-scale data warehouses in minutes instead of weeks or months.
Increase the frequency and pace of releases so you can innovate and improve your product faster. The quicker you can release new features and fix bugs, the faster you can respond to your customers’ needs and build competitive advantage. Continuous integration and continuous delivery are practices that automate the software release process, from build to deploy.
Ensure the quality of application updates and infrastructure changes so you can reliably deliver at a more rapid pace while maintaining a positive experience for end users. Use practices like continuous integration and continuous delivery to test that each change is functional and safe. Monitoring and logging practices help you stay informed of performance in real-time.
Continuous integration is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. The key goals of continuous integration are to find and address bugs quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.
Infrastructure as code is a practice in which infrastructure is provisioned and managed using code and software development techniques, such as version control and continuous integration. The cloud’s API-driven model enables developers and system administrators to interact with infrastructure programmatically, and at scale, instead of needing to manually set up and configure resources. Thus, engineers can interface with infrastructure using code-based tools and treat infrastructure in a manner similar to how they treat application code. Because they are defined by code, infrastructure and servers can quickly be deployed using standardized patterns, updated with the latest patches and versions, or duplicated in repeatable ways.
The term "security assessment" refers to all activity engaged in for the purposes of determining the efficacy or existence of security controls amongst your AWS assets, e.g., port-scanning, vulnerability scanning/checks, penetration testing, exploitation, web application scanning, as well as any injection, forgery, or fuzzing activity, either performed remotely against your AWS assets, amongst/between your AWS assets, or locally within the virtualized assets themselves.
Early and proactive detection of these deviations enables you to take corrective actions, such as retraining models, auditing upstream systems, or fixing quality issues without having to monitor models manually or build additional tooling.
AWS offers commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) IT services according to IT quality and security standards such as ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, ISO 9001, NIST 800-53 and many others.
We have about 300+ microservices right now that are being reviewed and managed by CodeGuru Reviewer.
The software development starts with design documents and reviews, and moves through code reviews. A security review will be conducted by both the independent AWS Security team as well as the Amazon EC2 engineering team for significant changes or features.
Once code reviews and approvals are complete, and all automated checks are passed, our automated package deployment process takes over. As part of this automated deployment pipeline, binary artifacts are built and teams run end-to-end, validation, and security-specific tests. If any type of validation fails, the deployment process is halted until the issue is remediated.
If a package is not included as part of a validated system, then by implication it is not approved for use within the controlled environment. If the environment permits a user to install their own packages the onus would be on the user to take extra precautions to ensure that it behaves as expected for their specific use case. In all cases, it is expected that users would follow their internal Quality Assurance Standard Operating Procedures.
Our dedicated security team includes some of the world's foremost experts in information security, application security, cryptography, and network security. This team maintains our defense systems, develops security review processes, builds security infrastructure, and implements our security policies. The team actively scans for security threats using commercial and custom tools. The team also conducts penetration tests and performs quality assurance and security reviews.
Monitoring and automated recovery: You should bake monitoring and logging into your cloud-native systems from inception. Logging and monitoring data streams can naturally be used for monitoring the health of the system, but can have many uses beyond this.
This means that almost all of the principles of good architectural design still apply for cloud-native architecture.
The largest design constraint for the implementation of the project is financial.
Optimal solutions identified for differing design constraints in a short time.
To investigate this question, we first present and formalize the design constraints for building an autonomous driving system in terms of performance, predictability, storage, thermal and power.
Among all the practices that SLSA and NIST SSDF promote, using application-level security scanning as part of continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) systems for production releases was the most common practice, with 63% of respondents saying this was “very” or “completely” established. Preserving code history and using build scripts are also highly established, while signing metadata and requiring a two-person review process have the most room for growth.
Testing an ML system is more involved than testing other software systems. In addition to typical unit and integration tests, you need data validation, trained model quality evaluation, and model validation.
Continuous delivery of models: An ML pipeline in production continuously delivers prediction services to new models that are trained on new data. The model deployment step, which serves the trained and validated model as a prediction service for online predictions, is automated.
Network automation substantially increases network efficiency to lower the cost per bit and maximize profit.
While hyper-scale cloud operators drove much of the new technologies and systems that they used to build their infrastructure, most enterprises do not have the time, skillset, or resources to build out their own homegrown cloud automation platform.
Modern network architectures require a system approach with real-time automation, using open state-streaming APIs for continuous real-time synchronization of network state and configuration, and providing advanced AI/ML analytics to provide instantaneous compliance, visibility, and troubleshooting.
CloudVision is a modern, multi-domain network management platform built on cloud networking principles for telemetry, analytics, and automation.
Scrum tracks work using product backlog items (PBIs) and bugs on the Kanban board or viewed on a sprint Taskboard.
Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) supports a framework for process improvement and an auditable record of decisions. With this process, you can track requirements, change requests, risks, and reviews. This process supports formal change management activities.
Good Scrum Masters have or develop excellent communication, negotiation, and conflict resolution skills.
The members of the Scrum team actually build the product. The team owns the engineering of the product, and the quality that goes with it.
In sprint planning, the team chooses backlog items to work on in the upcoming sprint. The team chooses backlog items based on priority and what they believe they can complete in the sprint. The sprint backlog is the list of items the team plans to deliver in the sprint. Often, each item on the sprint backlog is broken down into tasks. Once all members agree the sprint backlog is achievable, the sprint starts.
Alleviate technical debt with IT modernization that works.
Even so, organizations have invested money, time, and training in their existing infrastructure and need to maximize its value and return. This technical debt often leaves little budget and time for innovation.
Technical debt is a metaphor that is defined as the result of an IT departments preference to taking shortcuts using basic techniques comma not considering long-term consequences when developing and implementing code comma and delaying the upgrade of infrastructure on a timely basis.
Utilizing Legacy software development platforms that require a high number of lines of code versus rapid application development platforms Legacy platforms generate technical debt due to their coding complexity in the Labor standardization while rapid application development platforms bracket such as a low code or no code bracket provide a visual development approach which can save up to 40 to 50% of coding effort.
Generally, when you’re tracking and prioritising technical debt work, engineering mostly focuses on non-optimal code — or short-term implementation shortcuts — used to deliver a project faster.
Rich text editors are inherently complex, with busy feature roadmaps, which creates an environment where both technical and functional debt rapidly accrue.
The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software. The goal of SDLC is to minimize project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond. This methodology outlines a series of steps that divide the software development process into tasks you can assign, complete, and measure.
The software development lifecycle (SDLC) outlines several tasks required to build a software application. The development process goes through several stages as developers add new features and fix bugs in the software.
It contains standards for naming objects, collections, and variables, and guidelines for developing consistent, performant, and easily maintainable apps.
As we mention in the white paper, these coding standards and guidelines are flexible and serve as a starting point for organizations to develop their own standards. This white paper is intended to be a living document.
The standard is comprised of 12 parts that span the breadth of the automotive safety lifecycle including management, development, production, operation service, and decommissioning.
Static code analysis to identify coding standards and security vulnerabilities during development (Appendix E.3.3).
Custom coding rules can be authored for specific API or organizational coding standards as required using the Code XM extension framework.
During development, Synopsys enables developers to ensure that their code conforms to ISO 26262 design principles. This is accomplished primarily by implementing industry-specific coding standards rules such as MISRA C/C++.
Now, three years post-implementation, AHIMA is defining a “new normal” by establishing ICD-10-CM/PCS coding productivity benchmarks. To do so, several building blocks have been created, to be followed by an AHIMA-led systemic, highly credible study resulting in the standard for coding productivity.
February 2016, coding productivity was at approximately 50 percent of the standard established in 2007, about 40 minutes (or 1.5 records per hour).

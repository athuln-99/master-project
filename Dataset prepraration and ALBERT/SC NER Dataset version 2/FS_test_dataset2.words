Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud.
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you ensure that you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application. You create collections of EC2 instances, called Auto Scaling groups. You can specify the minimum number of instances in each Auto Scaling group, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group never goes below this size.
With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data and serve any level of request traffic.
Recent advances in programmable data planes, software-defined networking, and the adoption of IPv6, support novel, more complex load balancing strategies.
If your system becomes sufficiently complex, you may need to use more than one kind of load management. For example, you might run several managed instance groups that scale with load but are cloned across multiple regions for capacity; therefore, you also need to balance traffic between regions. In this case, your system needs to use both load balancing and load-based autoscaling.
In brief, the load balancer didn’t know that the “efficient” requests were errors because the load shedding and load balancing systems weren’t communicating. Each system was added and enabled separately, likely by different engineers. No one had examined them as one unified load management system.
Autoscaling is a powerful tool, but it’s easy to get wrong. Unless carefully configured, autoscaling can result in disastrous consequences—for example, potentially catastrophic feedback cycles between load balancing, load shedding, and autoscaling when these tools are configured in isolation. As the Pokémon GO case study illustrates, traffic management works best when it’s based upon a holistic view of the interactions between systems.
Time and time again, we’ve seen that no amount of load shedding, autoscaling, or throttling will save our services when they all fail in sync.
Several techniques have been reported in the literature to improve performance and resource use based on load balancing, task scheduling, resource management, quality of service, and workload management. Load balancing in the cloud allows data centers to avoid overloading/underloading in virtual machines, which itself is a challenge in the field of cloud computing. Therefore, it becomes a necessity for developers and researchers to design and implement a suitable load balancer for parallel and distributed cloud environments.
Thus, there is a need to identify the issues that affect LBC and develop an effective load balancing technique for cloud environments.
OLTP or Online Transaction Processing is a type of data processing that consists of executing a number of transactions occurring concurrently—online banking, shopping, order entry, or sending text messages, for example. These transactions traditionally are referred to as economic or financial transactions, recorded and secured so that an enterprise can access the information anytime for accounting or reporting purposes.
As IT struggles to keep pace with the speed of business, it is important that when you choose an operational database you consider your immediate data needs and long-term data requirements.
For storing transactions, maintaining systems of record, or content management, you will need a database with high concurrency, high throughput, low latency, and mission-critical characteristics such as high availability, data protection, and disaster recovery.
Also, if your data needs grow and you want to expand the functionality of your application, adding more single-purpose or fit-for-purpose databases will only create data silos and amplify the data management problems.
Select a future-proof cloud database service with self-service capabilities that will automate all the data management so that your data consumers—developers, analysts, data engineers, data scientists and DBAs—can do more with the data and accelerate application development.
They had to evolve to handle the modern-day transactions, heterogeneous data, and global scale, and most importantly to run mixed workloads. Relational databases transformed into multimodal databases that store and process not only relational data but also all other types of data, including xml, html, JSON, Apache Avro and Parquet, and documents in their native form, without much transformation.
Provides managed MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQL Server databases on Google Cloud. It reduces maintenance cost and automates database provisioning, storage capacity management, back ups, and out-of-the-box high availability and disaster recovery/failover.
Indeed, at times too much information might overwhelm the user, threatening to saturate their workload capacity, a cognitive mechanism of limited size that distributes some resources, such as working memory, to cognitive processes as required.
Minimising the amount of cognitive resources spent on this cycle has the potential to decrease the imposition of the UI on the user’s workload capacity.
It implements an elastic resource provisioning approach in the datacenter. This algorithm takes the performance threshold as the baseline to scale the resources up or down.
Scalability means to the ability of the system to deal with an increasing amount of the servers in a capable manner.
Deciding where to handle services and tasks, as well as provisioning an adequate amount of computing resources for this handling, is a main challenge of edge computing systems.
We propose the concept of spare edge device to handle dynamic load changes in an elastic way, as well as algorithms for provisioning these devices with different QoS/cost tradeoffs.
The second impact of removing the read cache is that workload performance should stay steady as the working set size is increased beyond the size of the “caching” tier SSD.
The ECM Workload was executed regularly throughout the population, scaling to over 120,000 transactions per minute.
The Performance Efficiency pillar includes the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
S3 Object Tags are key-value pairs applied to S3 objects which can be created, updated or deleted at any time during the lifetime of the object. With these, you have the ability to create Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, set up S3 Lifecycle policies, and customize storage metrics.
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can use Amazon S3 to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics. Amazon S3 provides management features so that you can optimize, organize, and configure access to your data to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed database that developers and database administrators have relied on for more than 10 years.
Before auto scaling, you would statically provision capacity in order to meet a table’s peak load plus a small buffer. In most cases, however, it isn’t cost-effective to statically provision a table above peak capacity.
Set up, operate, and scale a managed relational database in the cloud. Although you can set up a database on an EC2 instance, Amazon RDS offers the advantage of handling your database management tasks, such as patching the software, backing up, and storing the backups.
Apache CouchDB (link resides outside ibm.com) is an open source NoSQL document database that collects and stores data in JSON-based document formats. Unlike relational databases, CouchDB uses a schema-free data model, which simplifies record management across various computing devices, mobile phones, and web browsers.
A 30 GB encrypted EBS instance root volume used by the host operating system and Databricks internal services.
Hadoop MapReduce is described as "a software framework for easily writing applications which process vast amounts of data (multi-terabyte data sets) in parallel on large clusters (thousands of nodes) of commodity hardware in a reliable, fault-tolerant manner."
MapReduce filters and sorts data while converting it into key-value pairs.
When the amount of data in a company reaches a particularly large volume, increases rapidly and includes diverse data formats, this is referred to as a big data scenario.
When the data volume achieves a magnitude of about 100 TB, specialized and optimized relational database systems reach their architectural and technical limits. As the volume of data increases, so does the effort required to keep the data operationally available and consistent. Relational databases of this size are customized and require cost-intensive hardware.
One estimate is that 80% of all data today is unstructured; unstructured data is growing 15 times faster than structured data4 and the total volume of data is expected to grow to 40 zettabytes (10^21 bytes) by 2020.
Based on continuous observation of resource utilization trends, data-volume processing projections are offered to help with capacity planning. CLAIRE takes this to the next step by offering auto-scaling of data management runtime resources.
The system must be able to scale with the growth in data size and query volume. For example, it must support trillions of rows and petabytes of data. The update and query performance must hold even as these parameters grow significantly.
Mesa is Google's solution to these technical and operational challenges. Even though subsets of these requirements are solved by existing data warehousing systems, Mesa is unique in solving all of these problems simultaneously for business critical data. Mesa is a distributed, replicated, and highly available data processing, storage, and query system for structured data. Mesa ingests data generated by upstream services, aggregates and persists the data internally, and serves the data via user queries. Even though this paper mostly discusses Mesa in the context of ads metrics, Mesa is a generic data warehousing solution that satisfies all of the above requirements.
Data unification allows for a single source of information in one repository, creating a shared ecosystem of large amounts of data that users can leverage in real time.
Photon is deployed within Google Advertising System to join data streams such as web search queries and user clicks on advertisements. It produces joined logs that are used to derive key business metrics, including billing for advertisers. Our production deployment processes millions of events per minute at peak with an average end-to-end latency of less than 10 seconds.
Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer “siloed.” Sometimes, these two teams are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function.
Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. It expands upon continuous integration by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and/or a production environment after the build stage. When continuous delivery is implemented properly, developers will always have a deployment-ready build artifact that has passed through a standardized test process.
You're familiar with creating and managing IAM users, roles, and policies. You want to ensure that your development engineers and quality assurance team members can access the resources they need. You also need a strategy that scales as your company grows.

At Atlassian, many of our services have hundreds of check-ins per deployment. While code reviews from our development team do a great job of preventing bugs from reaching production, it’s not always possible to predict how systems will behave under stress or manage complex data shapes, especially as we have multiple deployments per day.
AWS provides the AWS Well-Architected Tool to help you review your approach prior to development, the state of your workloads prior to production, and the state of your workloads in production. You can compare workloads to the latest AWS architectural best practices, monitor their overall status, and gain insight into potential risks.
Automated processes can repair, scale, deploy your system far faster than people can.
Infrastructure: Automate the creation of the infrastructure, together with updates to it, using tools like Google Cloud Deployment Manager or Terraform
The development and integration of the new software components into the existing open source software application is a major constraint.
Reducing power consumption will require adding architectural improvements to process and circuit improvements. Thus, elevating power to a first-class constraint must be a priority early in the design stage when architectural tradeoffs are made as designers perform cycle-accurate simulation.
CI plays an increasingly important role in DevOps, allowing enterprises to drive quality from the start of their development cycle.
OSS-Fuzz offers CIFuzz, a GitHub action/CI job that runs your fuzz targets on pull requests. This works similarly to running unit tests in CI. CIFuzz helps you find and fix bugs before they make it into your codebase. Currently, CIFuzz primarily supports projects hosted on GitHub. Non-OSS-Fuzz users can use CIFuzz with additional features through ClusterFuzzLite.
Lighthouse CI is a suite of tools for using Lighthouse during continuous integration. Lighthouse CI can be incorporated into developer workflows in many different ways.
DevOps is a popular practice in developing and operating large-scale software systems. This practice provides benefits such as shortening the development cycles, increasing deployment velocity, and dependable releases. To achieve these benefits, you introduce two concepts in the software system development: Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD)
The steps of the ML experiment are orchestrated. The transition between steps is automated, which leads to rapid iteration of experiments and better readiness to move the whole pipeline to production.

Scrum Masters help build and maintain healthy teams by employing Scrum processes. They guide, coach, teach, and assist Scrum teams in the proper employment of Scrum methods. Scrum Masters also act as change agents to help teams overcome impediments and to drive the team toward significant productivity increases.
Daily Scrum meetings help keep a team focused on what it needs to do the next day. Staying focused helps the team maximize their ability to meet sprint commitments. Your Scrum Master should enforce the structure of the meeting and ensure that it starts on time and finishes in 15 minutes or less.
The product owner is responsible for what the team builds, and why they build it. The product owner is responsible for keeping the backlog of work up to date and in priority order
The product backlog is a prioritized list of work the team can deliver. The product owner is responsible for adding, changing, and reprioritizing the backlog as needed. The items at the top of the backlog should always be ready for the team to execute on.
The team takes time to reflect on what went well and which areas need improvement. The outcome of the retrospective are actions for the next sprint.
Engineers tend to notice technical debt. Designers more likely notice functional debt.
The application development life cycle management (ADLM) tool market focuses on the planning and governance activities of the software development life cycle (SDLC). ADLM products focus on the "development" portion of an application's life.
The agile model arranges the SDLC phases into several development cycles. The team iterates through the phases rapidly, delivering only small, incremental software changes in each cycle. They continuously evaluate requirements, plans, and results so that they can respond quickly to change. The agile model is both iterative and incremental, making it more efficient than other process models.
In traditional software development, security testing was a separate process from the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
The abbreviation SDLC can sometimes refer to the systems development lifecycle, the process for planning and creating an IT system.
The reason why coding standards are important is that they help to ensure safety, security, and reliability. Every development team should use one. Even the most experienced developer could introduce a coding defect — without realizing it. And that one defect could lead to a minor glitch.
There are several established standards. Some are specifically designed for functional safety — such as MISRA. Others are focused on secure coding, including CERT.
Coverity allows the enforcement of commonly used language subsets and coding standards – e.g. MISRA C/C++, AUTOSAR C++, CERT C/C++, and others.

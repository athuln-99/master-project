Simple scaling—Increase and decrease the current capacity of the group based on a single scaling adjustment, with a cooldown period between each scaling activity.
If you are scaling based on a metric that increases or decreases proportionally to the number of instances in an Auto Scaling group, we recommend that you use target tracking scaling policies. Otherwise, we recommend that you use step scaling policies.
An Auto Scaling group has a maximum capacity of 12, a current capacity of 10, and a dynamic scaling policy that adds 5 capacity units.
NoSQL cloud database services, like Amazon DynamoDB, are popular for their simple key-value operations, unbounded scalability and predictable low-latency. Atomic transactions, while popular in relational databases, carry the specter of complexity and low performance, especially when used for workloads with high contention. Transactions often have been viewed as inherently incompatible with NoSQL stores, and the few commercial services that combine both come with limitations. This talk examines the tension between transactions and non-relational databases, and it recounts my journey of adding transactions to DynamoDB.

This simply means that the software intelligent load balancers are also used to provide actionable insights to an organization. In this section, we look at how routing is done in SDN to facilitate for intelligent load balancing. In order to appreciate the power of intelligent load balancing routing in SDN and its advantages, we first cover a summary of load balancing routing in IP networks.
Load unbalancing problem is a multi-variant, multi-constraint problem that degrades performance and efficiency of computing resources. Load balancing techniques cater the solution for load unbalancing situation for two undesirable facets- overloading and under-loading.
It has sustained the rapid global growth of Google services, and it also provides network load balancing for Google Cloud Platform.
We’ll discuss Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB) as a concrete example of large-scale load balancing, but nearly all of the best practices we describe also apply to other cloud providers’ load balancers.
Load balancing provides the facility to distribute the workload equally on available resources. Its objective is to provide continuous service in case of failure of any service’s component by provisioning and deprovisioning the application instances along with proper utilization of resources.
The choice depends heavily on your use case — transactional processing, analytical processing, in-memory database, and so on — but it also depends on other factors. This post covers the different database options available within Google Cloud across relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases and explains which use cases are best suited for each database option.
However, benchmarking and comparing the energy efficiency of GPGPU workloads is challenging as standardized workloads are rare and standardized power and efficiency measurement methods and metrics do not exist. In addition, not all GPGPU systems run at maximum load all the time. Systems that are utilized in transactional, request driven workloads, for example, can run at lower utilization levels. Existing benchmarks for GPGPU systems primarily consider performance and are intended only to run at maximum load.
Generally, the providers implement an automatic provisioning approach via the virtualization technique. Virtualization makes it possible to rapidly scale the resources up or down. The aforementioned approaches present a reactive method, which is triggered by a certain threshold, such as CPU utilization or memory utilization. Actually, two or more thresholds should be used as a performance metric.
Thus, combining this with an automatic method and a proactive method would be more agile for provisioning the resources. For example, the Elastic VM architecture provisions the resources dynamically to reduce the SLA violation. However, the elasticity is necessary to meet the users’ demand from different perspectives.
CloudScale is a system that automates the fine-grained resources in cloud computing infrastructures, determining the adaptive resources by the prediction.
This workload can be used to understand the maximum random read I/Os per second (IOPS) that a storage solution can deliver.

Scaling up database capacity can be a tedious and risky business. Even veteran developers and database administrators who understand the nuanced behavior of their database and application perform this work cautiously. Despite the current era of sharded NoSQL clusters, increasing capacity can take hours, days, or weeks.
HBase is an open-source, non-relational, distributed database modeled after Google's Bigtable. It was developed as part of Apache Software Foundation's Hadoop project and runs on top of Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) to provide BigTable-like capabilities for Hadoop.

By using Spark's distributed computation engine, the package allows users to run large scale data analysis such as selection, filtering, aggregation from R. Karau et al. (2015) provides a summary of the state-of-the-art on using Spark.
Storage volumes remain available during this scaling-up operation.
PayPal, an eBay company, has used Hadoop and other software tools to detect fraud, but the colossal volumes of data were so large their systems were unable to perform the analysis quickly enough.
However, high volumes of low cost data on low cost hardware should not be misinterpreted as a signal for reduced service level agreement (SLA) expectations.
For example, Leuven University Hospital (UZ Leuven) consolidated all its critical Sybase database storage along with storage used by less critical SQL Server applications on a single set of NetApp storage systems.
Big Data requires processing high volumes of low-density data, that is, data of unknown value, such as twitter data feeds, clicks on a web page, network traffic, sensor-enabled equipment capturing data at the speed of light, and many more. It is the task of Big Data to convert low-density data into high-density data, that is, data that has value. For some companies, this might be tens of terabytes, for others it may be hundreds of petabytes.
When the volume of data to be analyzed is of the order of terabytes or petabytes (billions of tweets or posts), scalable storage and computing solutions must be used, but no clear solutions today exist for the analysis of Exascale datasets.
As Exascale systems are likely to be based on large distributed memory hardware, MPI is one of the most natural programming systems.
ata locality mechanisms/constructs, like near-data computing must be designed and evaluated on big data applications when subsets of data are stored in nearby processors and by avoiding that locality is imposed when data must be moved. Other challenges concern data affinity control data querying (NoSQL approach), global data distribution and sharing patterns.
In order to resolve the contradiction between requirements of high performance and limited memory resource, we propose a scalable Main-Memory database system ScaMMDB which distributes data and operations to several nodes and makes good use of every node’s resource.
Napa: Powering Scalable Data Warehousing with Robust Query Performance at Google.
We need to store and serve these planet-scale data sets under extremely demanding requirements of scalability, sub-second query response times, availability even in the case of entire data center failures, strong consistency guarantees, ingesting a massive stream of updates coming from the applications used around the globe. We have developed and deployed in production an analytical data management system, called Napa, to meet these requirements.
At its core, Napa’s principal technologies for robust query performance include the aggressive use of materialized views that are maintained consistently as new data is ingested across multiple data centers. Our clients also demand flexibility in being able to adjust their query performance, data freshness, and costs to suit their unique needs. Robust query processing and flexible configuration of client databases are the hallmark of Napa design.
In some DevOps models, quality assurance and security teams may also become more tightly integrated with development and operations and throughout the application lifecycle. When security is the focus of everyone on a DevOps team, this is sometimes referred to as DevSecOps.
The DevOps model enables your developers and operations teams to achieve these results. For example, microservices and continuous delivery let teams take ownership of services and then release updates to them quicker.
Operate and manage your infrastructure and development processes at scale. Automation and consistency help you manage complex or changing systems efficiently and with reduced risk. For example, infrastructure as code helps you manage your development, testing, and production environments in a repeatable and more efficient manner.
AWS's policy regarding the use of security assessment tools and services allows significant flexibility for performing security assessments of your AWS assets while protecting other AWS customers and ensuring quality-of-service across AWS.
With Model Monitor, you can set alerts that notify you when there are deviations in the model quality.
In this blog post, we introduce Deequ, an open source tool developed and used at Amazon. Deequ allows you to calculate data quality metrics on your dataset, define and verify data quality constraints, and be informed about changes in the data distribution.
AWS implements formal, documented policies and procedures that provide guidance for operations and information security within the organization and the supporting AWS environments. Policies address purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities and management commitment. All policies are maintained in a centralized location that is accessible by employees.
To ensure the ultimate level of security, you need to integrate health checks into your workflow, and DevOps is the best method of achieving this goal. Amazon Inspector is one of the AWS tools for testers that is delivered as a service that facilitates an easier adoption into the existing DevOps process. DevSecOps extends DevOps with QA and entails continuous communication among operational teams, developers, and testers.
Integrate CodeGuru into your existing software development workflow to automate code reviews during application development and continuously monitor application's performance in production and provide recommendations and visual clues on how to improve code quality, application performance, and reduce overall cost.
While the functional aspects don't change too much, the cloud offers, and sometimes requires, very different ways to meet non-functional requirements, and imposes very different architectural constraints. If architects fail to adapt their approach to these different constraints, the systems they architect are often fragile, expensive, and hard to maintain. A well-architected cloud native system, on the other hand, should be largely self-healing, cost efficient, and easily updated and maintained through Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD).
Scale up and scale down: Unless your system load almost never changes, you should automate the scale up of the system in response to increases in load, and scale down in response to sustained drops in load. By scaling up, you ensure your service remains available, and by scaling down you reduce costs.
Resources can be provisioned as temporary, disposable units, freeing users from the inflexibility and constraints of a fixed and finite IT infrastructure.
With accelerator-based designs, we are able to build an end-to-end autonomous driving system that meets all the design constraints, and explore the trade-offs among performance, power and the higher accuracy enabled by higher resolution cameras.
To that end, the data indicate that organizational culture and modern development processes (such as continuous integration) are the biggest drivers of an organization’s software security and are the best place to start for organizations looking to improve their security posture.
Today, we are honored to share that Cloud Build, Google Cloud’s continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) platform, was named a Leader in The Forrester Wave™: Cloud-Native Continuous Integration Tools, Q3 2019. The report identifies the 10 CI providers that matter most for continuous integration (CI) and how they stack up on 27 criterias.
Rather, it means deploying an ML pipeline that can automate the retraining and deployment of new models. Setting up a CI/CD system enables you to automatically test and deploy new pipeline implementations. This system lets you cope with rapid changes in your data and business environment.
You can gradually implement these practices to help improve the automation of your ML system development and production.
An optional additional component for level 1 ML pipeline automation is a feature store.
Agile supports Agile planning methods (learn more about Agile methodologies at the Agile Alliance), including Scrum, and tracks development and test activities separately. This process works great if you want to track user stories and (optionally) bugs on the Kanban board, or track bugs and tasks on the Taskboard.
While bugs contribute to technical debt, they may not represent all debt.
Poor software design, poorly written code, or short-term fixes can all contribute to technical debt. Technical debt reflects extra development work that arises from all these problems.
Track work to address technical debt as PBIs, user stories, or bugs. To track a team's progress in incurring and addressing technical debt, you'll want to consider how to categorize the work item and the details you want to track.
Technical debt refers to the side effects of prioritising time, money, and workarounds over quality in the delivery of enterprise IT.
IDC predicts that through 2023, coping with technical debt accumulated during the pandemic will challenge 50% of CIOs. This technical debt is a result of what were imperative but necessarily fast-tracked implementations of solutions for new, remote working arrangements after the onset of COVID-19.
User satisfaction, value delivered and product marketability are as dependent on UI/UX as performance, and that’s where functional debt poses a threat. And similarly to technical debt, functional debt is hard to identify and pay down.
Technical debt is about how a feature was implemented.
SDLC or the Software Development Life Cycle is a process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time possible. SDLC provides a well-structured flow of phases that help an organization to quickly produce high-quality software which is well-tested and ready for production use.
Having achieved some understanding of the Project Management and System Development lifecycles, and having learned to discern relative value of their multitudinous deliverables, we are now well positioned to come up with a sequence of milestones that can communicate the status of the project in a fashion meaningful to the Project and Executive Sponsor layers of the organization.
The later a bug is found in the SDLC, the more expensive it becomes to fix. When a bug is found late in the cycle, developers must drop the work they are doing, and go back to revisit code they may have written weeks ago. Even worse, when a bug is found in production, the code gets sent all the way back to the beginning of the SDLC.
PowerApps canvas app coding standards and guidelines.
This white paper was developed as a collaboration between the Microsoft PowerApps team, Microsoft IT, and industry professionals. Of course, enterprise customers are free to develop their own standards and practices. However, we feel that adherence to these guidelines will help developers in these areas:
The standards and guidelines are targeted at the enterprise application maker (developer) who is responsible for designing, building, testing, deploying, and maintaining PowerApps apps in a small business, corporate, or government environment.
Synopsys is also involved as a member in formulating the SAE J3061 and ISO 21434 standards, which define comprehensive strategies for automotive cybersecurity.
The standard supplies numerous guidelines for software design and implementation to ensure the correct order of execution, consistency of interfaces, correctness of data flow and control flow, simplicity, readability and comprehensibility, and robustness.
